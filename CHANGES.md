Fedify changelog
================

Version 2.4.0
-------------

To be released.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `verifyProof()` so Ed25519 JCS proofs authenticate every received
    proof option except `proofValue`, including `expires`, `domain`,
    `challenge`, `nonce`, and extension options.  It now rejects expired or
    malformed proof options, and callers can provide expected `domain` and
    `challenge` values through `VerifyProofOptions` to prevent cross-domain or
    replay use.  [[#968]]

 -  Added `verifyPortableObjectProof()` to enforce the [FEP-ef61] proof policy
    for portable actors, activities, objects, and signed collections.  Its
    detailed result distinguishes documents outside the policy, unsecured
    collections, missing or invalid [FEP-8b32] proofs, unsupported verification
    methods, DID authority mismatches, and successful verification.
    [[#832], [#968]]

 -  Updated `verifyObject()` so [FEP-8b32] proofs signed by `did:key`
    verification methods can authenticate portable objects whose owner is an
    `ap:` or `ap+ef61:` URI with the same [FEP-fe34] cryptographic origin.
    [[#829], [#926]]

 -  Added local `did:key` verification method resolution for
    [FEP-8b32] Object Integrity Proofs.  `verifyProof()` can now verify
    Ed25519 `eddsa-jcs-2022` proofs whose `verificationMethod` is a
    `did:key:z...#z...` DID URL without fetching the verification method
    as a remote JSON-LD document, which is required for [FEP-ef61]
    portable objects.
    [[#827], [#915]]

 -  Added support for the [ActivityPub Media Upload extension] so that servers
    can accept client-to-server media uploads:
    [[#754], [#927]]

     -  `Federation` and `FederationBuilder` gained a `setMediaUploader()`
        method (through the new `MediaUploaderSetters` interface) that registers
        a `multipart/form-data` upload endpoint.  Its callback finalizes the
        uploaded `file` alongside the posted `object` shell and returns either
        the created object (`201 Created`) or the `URL` at which it will become
        available once processing finishes (`202 Accepted`).
     -  `Context` gained a `getMediaUploaderUri()` method for building the
        endpoint URI, which actor dispatchers advertise under the new
        `Endpoints.uploadMedia` property.
     -  A new metric endpoint category, `media_upload`, classifies these
        requests in the `fedify.endpoint` attribute.
     -  Fedify logs a runtime warning when a callback's returned URI does not
        point at a registered object dispatcher route, when a registered
        media uploader is not advertised under `endpoints.uploadMedia`, or
        when a media uploader is registered without an `authorize()` hook (so
        the endpoint would accept uploads from anyone).

 -  Added a custom background task API that generalizes Fedify's
    enqueue-and-process-later pattern to arbitrary application-defined jobs:

     -  `Federation` and `FederationBuilder` gained a `defineTask()` method
        through the new `TaskRegistry` interface, which `Federatable` now
        extends.
     -  `Context` gained `enqueueTask()` and `enqueueTaskMany()` methods,
        with `delay` and `orderingKey` options
        (new `TaskEnqueueOptions` interface).
     -  Every task requires a [Standard Schema]
        (`schema` option) from which the payload type is inferred; payloads
        are validated at enqueue time (fail fast) and again at dequeue time
        (protection against schema drift across deployments).
     -  Payloads are serialized by Fedify with devalue, so `Date`, `Map`,
        `Set`, `URL`, `bigint`, circular references, and Activity Vocabulary
        objects round-trip faithfully across every message queue backend.
     -  Failed handlers are retried with exponential backoff by default;
        tasks support per-task `retryPolicy` and `onError` options, the new
        `FederationOptions.taskRetryPolicy` sets the federation-wide default,
        and queues with `nativeRetrial` delegate retries to the backend.
     -  Tasks can be isolated from activity delivery through the new
        `FederationQueueOptions.task` slot or a per-task `queue` option;
        without them, tasks fall back to the outbox queue unless the new
        `FederationOptions.taskQueueResolution` option is set to `"strict"`.
        `Federation.startQueue()` now accepts `queue: "task"` to run
        a task-only worker.
     -  Tasks can request at-most-once enqueue with a `deduplicationKey`
        (new `TaskEnqueueOptions.deduplicationKey`).  A queue declaring the new
        `MessageQueue.nativeDeduplication` capability owns the check and
        receives the key through the new
        `MessageQueueEnqueueOptions.deduplicationKey`; otherwise Fedify
        performs a best-effort key–value guard through the optional
        `KvStore.cas` primitive, under a new `taskDeduplication` key prefix.
        The marker TTL and the no-`cas` fallback are tunable with the new
        `FederationOptions.taskDeduplicationTtl` and
        `FederationOptions.taskDeduplicationFallback` options.
        [[#206], [#797], [#798], [#799], [#803], [#806], [#812], [#923] by ChanHaeng Lee\]

 -  Added `MessageQueue.atomicEnqueueMany` for queues that implement
    `enqueueMany()` with separate sends.  Fedify still uses their batch path
    normally, but rejects a multi-message batch governed by one
    `deduplicationKey` before a partial send can undermine deduplication.
    [[#930], [#934]]

 -  Fixed CommonJS distribution files that use Temporal so they no longer
    require `@js-temporal/polyfill` at runtime.  The CommonJS build now
    bundles `temporal-polyfill`, while type declarations rely on the standard
    `esnext.temporal` lib reference.

### @fedify/astro

 -  Added and continuously tested support for Astro 6 and 7 while retaining
    Astro 5 compatibility.  The Astro example and `fedify init` templates now
    use Astro 7 with current Node.js and Deno adapters; Bun uses the tested
    `@astrojs/node` standalone output instead of the Astro-5-only
    `@nurodev/astro-bun` adapter.

### @fedify/cli

 -  Added \[SvelteKit\] option to `fedify init` command. This option allows
    users to initialize a new Fedify project with SvelteKit integration.
    [[#892], [#971] by Jang Hanarae\]
 -  Added `fedify.com.es` as a tunneling service.  The CLI pins the service's
    SSH host key and rejects a mismatched server before exposing a local port.
    [[#940]]
 -  Removed `localhost.run` as a tunneling service.  The service is no longer
    available, and the CLI now rejects attempts to use it.
    [[#940]]
 -  Switched the CLI's Temporal runtime dependency from
    `@js-temporal/polyfill` to `temporal-polyfill`.
    [[#823], [#925]]

### @fedify/debugger

 -  Fixed the CommonJS debugger build so it no longer requires
    `@js-temporal/polyfill` at runtime.  The build now bundles
    `temporal-polyfill`, while type declarations rely on the standard
    `esnext.temporal` lib reference.
    [[#823], [#925]]

### @fedify/init

 -  Added a `test` task to projects scaffolded by `fedify init`.  It starts
    the app, waits for it to become ready, and checks that it resolves a local
    actor, giving projects a standard smoke test to run right after scaffolding
    and whenever the app changes afterwards.  [[#898], [#990] by Jang Hanarae\]
 -  Added runtime version verification to `fedify init`. It checks that the
    selected Deno, Bun, or Node.js meets Fedify's minimum version, or a higher
    version required by a framework (such as Astro's Node.js 22.12), before
    generating a project. A missing, malformed, or unsupported runtime now
    produces a clear error in non-interactive mode and disables the affected
    package managers in interactive mode.  [[#964], [#981] by Lee Jeongmin\]
 -  Fixed `fedify init`'s hydration test validation to run `format` before
    `format:check`, which previously caused the entire test suite to fail when
    the package manager is `npm` or `pnpm`:
    [[#950]]
    [[#952] by Jang Hanarae\]
 -  Supported \[SvelteKit\] as a web framework option in
    `fedify init`.  [[#892], [#971] by Jang Hanarae\]

### @fedify/interaction-controls

 -  Added the new `@fedify/interaction-controls` package for implementing
    [GoToSocial interaction controls], [FEP-044f], and [FEP-7aa9].  It provides
    immutable TypeScript APIs for creating and verifying interaction requests
    and authorizations, evaluating `InteractionPolicy`, recognizing bare
    interactions, and formatting stable storage keys for like, reply, announce,
    quote, and feature interactions.

### @fedify/lint

 -  Added four lint rules for the media upload endpoint introduced in
    `@fedify/fedify`:
    [[#754], [#927]]

     -  `media-uploader-object-uri-required` warns when a `setMediaUploader()`
        callback does not derive its return value from `ctx.getObjectUri()`.
     -  `media-uploader-authorization-required` warns when `setMediaUploader()`
        is registered without an `.authorize()` hook.
     -  `actor-upload-media-property-required` warns when a media uploader is
        registered but the actor dispatcher does not advertise
        `endpoints.uploadMedia`.
     -  `actor-upload-media-property-mismatch` warns when
        `endpoints.uploadMedia` is not built with
        `ctx.getMediaUploaderUri(identifier)`.

 -  Added the `actor-preferred-username-required` lint rule, which warns
    when an actor dispatcher's return value does not include a
    `preferredUsername` property. [[#895], [#1022] by Jae-Hyuk-Jang\]

### @fedify/mysql

 -  Fixed the CommonJS MySQL adapter build so it no longer requires
    `@js-temporal/polyfill` at runtime.  The build now bundles
    `temporal-polyfill`, while type declarations rely on the standard
    `esnext.temporal` lib reference.
    [[#823], [#925]]

### @fedify/netlify

 -  Added `NetlifyBlobsKvStore`, a Netlify Blobs-backed key–value store with
    expiration, prefix listing, and atomic compare-and-set operations.  Netlify
    deployments can now persist Fedify state and preserve ordered queue
    delivery without a separate database.  [[#1010] by Jiwon Kwon\]
 -  Added the new *@fedify/netlify* package for processing Fedify message queue
    jobs with Netlify Async Workloads.  It provides `NetlifyMessageQueue` for
    durable event submission and `createNetlifyQueueHandler()` for Netlify
    Function consumers, including delayed delivery, native retry delegation,
    non-retryable malformed-event handling, durable per-key FIFO ordering, and
    explicit recovery for unobservable dead-letter failures.
    [[#930], [#934]]

[#1010]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/1010

### @fedify/pglite

 -  Added the `@fedify/pglite` package with `PgliteKvStore`, a `KvStore` backed
    by an embedded PGlite database.  It accepts a caller-created PGlite instance
    and is intended for a single PGlite instance in a single runtime isolate; a
    message queue is not provided because PGlite does not share data between
    processes.  [[#1018], [#1020] by ChanHaeng Lee\]

[#1018]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/1018
[#1020]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/1020

### @fedify/postgres

 -  Added `PostgresKvStore.cas()`, including atomic creation, replacement, and
    deletion with TTL-aware comparison.  This allows PostgreSQL-backed stores,
    including Netlify Database, to enforce queue ordering and other Fedify CAS
    operations.
    [[#930], [#934]]
 -  `PostgresKvStore` now creates crash-safe logged tables by default and
    migrates existing unlogged tables during initialization.  Transient
    unlogged storage remains available with the `unlogged` option.  The
    one-time migration rewrites and exclusively locks an existing table, so
    upgrades with large or busy key–value tables should schedule it
    accordingly.
    [[#930], [#934]]
 -  Fixed the CommonJS PostgreSQL adapter build so it no longer requires
    `@js-temporal/polyfill` at runtime.  The build now bundles
    `temporal-polyfill`, while type declarations rely on the standard
    `esnext.temporal` lib reference.
    [[#823], [#925]]

### @fedify/redis

 -  Fixed the CommonJS Redis adapter build so it no longer requires
    `@js-temporal/polyfill` at runtime.  The build now bundles
    `temporal-polyfill`, while type declarations rely on the standard
    `esnext.temporal` lib reference.
    [[#823], [#925]]

### @fedify/relay

 -  Fixed the CommonJS relay build so it no longer requires
    `@js-temporal/polyfill` at runtime.  The build now bundles
    `temporal-polyfill`, while type declarations rely on the standard
    `esnext.temporal` lib reference.
    [[#823], [#925]]
 -  Fixed the relay documentation to use the canonical actor and shared inbox
    URIs, distinguish Mastodon-style and LitePub-style subscription behavior,
    and explain which deployment responsibilities remain with applications.
    [[#899], [#996] by Jiwon Kwon\]

[#899]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/899
[#996]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/996

### @fedify/sqlite

 -  Fixed the CommonJS SQLite adapter build so it no longer requires
    `@js-temporal/polyfill` at runtime.  The build now bundles
    `temporal-polyfill`, while type declarations rely on the standard
    `esnext.temporal` lib reference.
    [[#823], [#925]]

### @fedify/testing

 -  Added `testKvStore()`, a conformance test suite for `KvStore`
    implementations, complementing `testMessageQueue()`.
    [[#1018], [#1020] by ChanHaeng Lee\]
 -  Fixed the CommonJS testing utilities build so it no longer requires
    `@js-temporal/polyfill` at runtime.  The build now bundles
    `temporal-polyfill`, while type declarations rely on the standard
    `esnext.temporal` lib reference.
    [[#823], [#925]]

### @fedify/vocab

 -  Added [FEP-ef61] vocabulary terms for portable ActivityPub objects.
    Actor classes now expose ordered `gateways` lists, and `Link` plus
    document/media classes expose `digestMultibase` for external resource
    integrity metadata.
    [[#830], [#928]]
 -  Updated [FEP-fe34] cross-origin checks to understand cryptographic origins
    for [FEP-ef61] portable ActivityPub IDs and DID URLs.  Generated property
    accessors and `lookupObject()` now treat `ap:`/`ap+ef61:` IDs and matching
    `did:key` verification method IDs as same-origin when their DID components
    match.
    [[#829], [#926]]
 -  Added support for [FEP-ef61] portable ActivityPub IRIs in generated
    vocabulary codecs.  `ap:` and `ap+ef61:` values with decoded or
    percent-encoded DID authorities now parse as `URL` objects, and JSON-LD
    serialization emits canonical `ap+ef61:` values with decoded DID
    authorities.
    [[#826], [#850]]
 -  Added vocabulary support for [FEP-7aa9], including
    `FeaturedCollection`, `FeaturedItem`, `FeatureRequest`, and
    `FeatureAuthorization`, plus actor `featuredCollections` and
    `InteractionPolicy.canFeature` properties.
    [[#810], [#914]]
 -  Added the `Endpoints.uploadMedia` property, the standard ActivityStreams
    endpoint for the [ActivityPub Media Upload extension].
    [[#754], [#927]]
 -  Fixed the CommonJS vocabulary build so it no longer requires
    `@js-temporal/polyfill` at runtime.  The build now bundles
    `temporal-polyfill`, while type declarations rely on the standard
    `esnext.temporal` lib reference.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added SHA-256 `digestMultibase` and simple `hl:` hashlink helpers for
    computing, parsing, creating, and verifying portable media resource
    digests as required by [FEP-ef61].
    [[#831], [#935]]
 -  Added the [FEP-ef61] JSON-LD context to the preloaded context registry so
    portable actor and media documents can compact and expand `gateways` and
    `digestMultibase` without fetching the context remotely.
    [[#830], [#928]]
 -  Added `getFe34Origin()` and `haveSameFe34Origin()` for comparing ordinary
    web origins and [FEP-ef61] cryptographic origins with one shared
    [FEP-fe34] helper.  HTTP(S) URLs keep web-origin semantics, while
    `ap:`/`ap+ef61:` URIs and DID URLs use their DID component as the origin.
    [[#829], [#926]]
 -  Added `canonicalizePortableUri()` and `arePortableUrisEqual()` for
    comparing [FEP-ef61] portable ActivityPub URI strings.  The helpers accept
    `ap:` and `ap+ef61:` values with decoded or percent-encoded DID
    authorities, normalize them to `ap+ef61:`, and ignore query hints such as
    `gateways` during comparison.
    [[#828], [#924]]
 -  Added the [FEP-7aa9] JSON-LD context to the preloaded context registry so
    FEP-7aa9 documents can be compacted and expanded without fetching the
    context remotely.
    [[#810], [#914]]
 -  Added helpers for Ed25519 `did:key` DIDs and verification method DID
    URLs: `exportDidKey()` exports public keys to base58-btc `did:key` DIDs,
    `importDidKey()` imports supported DIDs back to `CryptoKey`, and
    `parseDidKeyVerificationMethod()` validates `did:key:z...#z...`
    verification methods.
    [[#827], [#915]]
 -  Changed `getDocumentLoader()` to reject HTML and XHTML responses that do
    not advertise an ActivityPub alternate document with a `FetchError`
    instead of attempting to parse the HTML as JSON.  This makes remote HTML
    error pages surface as document loading failures with the response URL and
    content type, rather than generic JSON parser crashes.

Version 2.3.6
-------------

Released on August 23, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed some public relay subscription requests being rejected by
    implementations that compare `Follow.object` as a plain URL without JSON-LD
    expansion.  The Public collection in relay `Follow` activities is now
    serialized as its full ActivityStreams URI instead of a compact IRI.

[#1008]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/1008

### @fedify/cli

 -  Added a permanent removal warning to the `fedify init` command for Linux
    and other Unix-like system users before deleting existing content in the
    project directory.

### @fedify/init

 -  Added permanent removal warning for Linux or other UNIX-like system users
    before delete the existing content in the project directory.
    [[#989], [#997] by Jungmin Yoon\]

### @fedify/lint

 -  Fixed `@fedify/lint` actor property requirement rules reporting false
    positives when an actor dispatcher returns `null` for an actor that was not
    found.  Non-null actor returns are still checked for the configured
    properties.  [[#974]]

[#974]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/974

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added the [Controlled Identifiers v1.0] context to the preloaded JSON-LD
    contexts.  The default document loader now resolves
    <https://www.w3.org/ns/cid/v1> locally, so transient W3C outages no longer
    prevent otherwise valid inbound documents from being parsed or verified.
    [[#932]]

Version 2.3.5
-------------

Released on August 22, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a remotely triggerable denial-of-service vulnerability where the
    outbound delivery circuit breaker, when configured with a custom `failure`
    policy without an explicit `stateTtl`, stored per-host state in the
    configured key–value store without any expiry.  A remote attacker could
    accumulate unbounded permanent records—one per distinct inbox
    `host:port`—by advertising inbox URLs that fail delivery, gradually
    exhausting storage.  Custom failure policies now derive a default
    `stateTtl` of `recoveryDelay` plus `heldActivityTtl` (7 days 30 minutes
    with the default values), and the automatic upgrade sweep on CAS-backed
    stores now stamps a TTL on circuit state that earlier 2.3 releases wrote
    without one, including state written by custom policies on 2.3.2–2.3.4.
    Set `stateTtl` explicitly if your custom policy needs its failure history
    retained for a different length of time.  \[[CVE-2026-69132]]
 -  Fixed a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in authenticated
    document loaders, where an otherwise public document URL could redirect a
    signed request to a loopback, link-local, or private address.  Redirect
    targets are now validated before they are fetched, while the explicit
    `allowPrivateAddress` option continues to permit private addresses.

### @fedify/elysia

 -  Fixed duplicate response headers on Elysia 1.4.18 and earlier, which
    append both `set.headers` and the returned `Response`'s own headers
    without deduplication.  The `fedify()` plugin no longer sets the headers
    in both places.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added the [FEP-ef61] context to preloaded JSON-LD contexts.  The
    <https://w3id.org/fep/ef61> URL redirects to a Codeberg Pages host which
    suffers recurring outages; during one, JSON-LD expansion of any document
    referencing this URL fails before application handlers can run.
    [[#982], [#928]]
 -  Changed `miscellany` context to match public version 1.0.1,
    which fixes a bug with re-compacting Mastodon and similar content using
    `boolean` flags (`manuallyApprovesFollowers`, `sensitive`).

Version 2.3.4
-------------

Released on July 29, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added <https://purl.archive.org/miscellany> (the
    [SWICG ActivityPub Miscellaneous Terms] context, referenced by every Bridgy
    Fed activity) to preloaded JSON-LD contexts.  The context is served through
    purl.archive.org, which suffers recurring outages; during one, JSON-LD
    expansion of any activity referencing this URL fails before application
    handlers can run. [[#965] by Michael Barrett]

Version 2.3.3
-------------

Released on July 19, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Fixed document loaders rejecting public URLs backed by CNAMEs on
    Cloudflare Workers.  `validatePublicUrl()` now ignores non-IP aliases
    returned alongside DNS lookup results while continuing to validate every
    resolved IP address, and rejects lookups that return no IP addresses.

[#957]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/957

### @fedify/cfworkers

 -  Fixed `WorkersMessageQueue.enqueueMany()` failing when the given messages
    exceeded Cloudflare Queues' batch limits of 100 messages or 256 KB per
    batch, which could happen when delivering activities to a large audience.
    The method now estimates the serialized size of each message and splits
    the messages into multiple `sendBatch()` calls that stay within the
    limits.  [[#958], [#960] by SJang1]

Version 2.3.2
-------------

Released on July 15, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the
    `getNodeInfo()` function and the `Context.lookupNodeInfo()` method, where
    the NodeInfo document URL advertised in a remote server's
    `/.well-known/nodeinfo` response was fetched without checking that it
    points to a public address.  A malicious server could direct the link to
    a loopback, link-local, or private address—or to a `data:` URL—causing
    Fedify to fetch internal resources and return their contents to the
    caller.  Both requests, including any redirect hops, are now validated
    against private and non-public addresses, consistent with the protections
    already applied to WebFinger lookups and the built-in document loader.
    [[CVE-2026-62857]]

 -  Fixed custom collection dispatchers registered through
    `FederationBuilder.setCollectionDispatcher()` and
    `setOrderedCollectionDispatcher()` returning `404 Not Found` after
    `build()`.  `build()` now copies the collection callbacks and item types
    onto the built federation, so the registered routes dispatch their
    collections instead of being treated as unknown routes.
    [[#849], [#851] by ChanHaeng Lee]

 -  Fixed the outbound delivery circuit breaker retaining per-host state in the
    configured key–value store forever when a remote host never recovered.
    Circuit breaker state now receives a TTL on writes made with the default
    failure policy, custom failure policies can opt in with the new `stateTtl`
    option, and stale state written by earlier 2.3 releases is cleared
    automatically on CAS-backed stores after upgrade, with another sweep after a
    grace window to cover rolling deployments.  [[#916], [#917]]

 -  Fixed split-origin WebFinger responses for `acct:` aliases on the web
    origin host.  When a local actor is queried through the server-origin
    `acct:` alias, Fedify now returns the canonical handle-host `acct:` URI as
    the JRD `subject` and keeps the queried `acct:` URI in `aliases`.
    [[#920], [#921]]

 -  Fixed the npm package published by CI/CD so it includes the Fedify agent
    skill at *skills/fedify/SKILL.md*.  The package metadata already advertised
    the skill, and local `pnpm pack` builds included it, but the automated
    npm publish artifact skipped the `prepack` step that materializes the
    symlinked skill directory before packing.

### @fedify/vocab

 -  Fixed Activity Vocabulary parsing so malformed language tags in remote
    JSON-LD language maps no longer abort parsing with a `RangeError`.  Fedify
    now ignores only the malformed language-tagged value and continues parsing
    the rest of the object.  [[#847], [#848]]

[#848]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/848

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify nodeinfo` choosing SVG favicons whose filenames use
    uppercase `.SVG` extensions or include query strings or fragments.  The
    command now ignores those SVG favicon links and falls back to
    `/favicon.ico` before rendering terminal art.

Version 2.3.1
-------------

Released on June 27, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed outbound activity delivery aborting when Linked Data Signatures
    creation fails during JSON-LD canonicalization.  Fedify now logs the
    signing failure and continues delivery without the Linked Data Signature
    for JSON-LD processing failures, while still surfacing key, configuration,
    and programming errors from signing.  [[#824], [#842] by Lee ByeongJun]

 -  Fixed inbox verification crashing when a remote actor document contains a
    malformed `publicKey` entry.  Fedify now treats the malformed key as a
    failed key lookup so HTTP Signatures verification fails normally instead of
    returning a server error.  [[#825], [#844] by Lee ByeongJun]

Version 2.3.0
-------------

Released on June 25, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Added `mapActorAlias()` method to `ActorCallbackSetters` interface to
    support fixed-path actor dispatchers.  This is useful for exposing a
    single, instance-level actor at a fixed path, such as `/actor` for a relay
    or `/bot` for a bot, without leaking a sentinel identifier into the actor's
    URI. [[#752], [#753]]

 -  Added optional `MessageQueue.getDepth()` support, using the new
    `MessageQueueDepth` return type, for reporting queue backlog depth.
    `InProcessMessageQueue` can now report queued messages, including ready
    and delayed counts, and `ParallelMessageQueue` delegates depth reporting
    to its wrapped queue when supported.  [[#735], [#748]]

 -  Added OpenTelemetry metrics for ActivityPub delivery attempts, permanent
    delivery failures, inbox listener processing duration, and HTTP Signature
    verification failures.  Applications can pass the new `meterProvider`
    option to `createFederation()`, and `Context.meterProvider` exposes the
    provider available to request, inbox, and outbox code.
    [[#316], [#619], [#755]]

 -  Added the `activitypub.delivery.failed` span event to queued outbox
    delivery spans so retry and permanent-failure decisions include the
    remote host, attempt number, and HTTP status code when available.
    [[#316], [#619], [#755]]

 -  *Breaking change*: Changed the `activitypub.activity.sent` span event to
    record delivery metadata (`activitypub.inbox.url` and
    `activitypub.activity.id`) instead of the full `activitypub.activity.json`
    payload.  `FedifySpanExporter` now stores outbound records from those
    attributes, and `TraceActivityRecord.activityJson` is present only when the
    span event includes full activity JSON.  [[#316], [#619], [#755]]

 -  Added two OpenTelemetry histograms for signature verification:
    `activitypub.signature.verification.duration` measures end-to-end
    verification time for HTTP Signatures, Linked Data Signatures, and
    Object Integrity Proofs (including local key lookup and remote key
    fetches), and `activitypub.signature.key_fetch.duration` measures
    public key lookup duration separately so operators can isolate
    non-fetch verification work.  Both instruments carry
    `activitypub.signature.kind` (`http`, `linked_data`, or
    `object_integrity`) and bounded result attributes; the verification
    histogram additionally carries spec-bounded
    `http_signatures.algorithm`, `ld_signatures.type`, or
    `object_integrity_proofs.cryptosuite` when known, plus
    `http_signatures.failure_reason` on rejected HTTP rows.
    [[#316], [#737], [#769]]

 -  Added OpenTelemetry HTTP server metrics for inbound requests handled by
    `Federation.fetch()`: `fedify.http.server.request.count` (Counter) and
    `fedify.http.server.request.duration` (Histogram).  Both instruments carry
    `http.request.method`, `fedify.endpoint`, optional
    `http.response.status_code`, and optional `fedify.route.template`
    attributes so that operators can monitor aggregate request rate, latency,
    and status-code error rate even when traces are sampled.  Attributes
    deliberately exclude raw URLs, query strings, and identifier values to
    keep cardinality bounded.  [[#316], [#736], [#757]]

 -  Added OpenTelemetry metrics for ActivityPub collection requests handled
    by `Federation.fetch()` and custom collection handlers:

     -  `activitypub.collection.request` (counter)
     -  `activitypub.collection.dispatch.duration` (histogram)
     -  `activitypub.collection.page.items` (histogram)
     -  `activitypub.collection.total_items` (histogram)

    The metrics expose bounded collection dimensions:
    `activitypub.collection.kind`, `activitypub.collection.page`,
    `activitypub.collection.result`, `fedify.collection.dispatcher`, and
    optional `http.response.status_code`.  Built-in collections are classified
    as `inbox`, `outbox`, `following`, `followers`, `liked`, `featured`, or
    `featured_tags`; application-defined collection routes are collapsed into
    `custom`.  Collection IDs, cursors, custom route names, actor identifiers,
    and full URLs are deliberately excluded so dashboards can aggregate
    collection rate, latency, item counts, and `totalItems` values without
    attacker-controlled cardinality.  [[#316], [#741], [#777]]

 -  Added OpenTelemetry queue task metrics covering Fedify's enqueue and
    worker boundaries for inbox, outbox, and fanout work:

     -  `fedify.queue.task.enqueued` (counter)
     -  `fedify.queue.task.started` (counter)
     -  `fedify.queue.task.completed` (counter)
     -  `fedify.queue.task.failed` (counter)
     -  `fedify.queue.task.duration` (histogram)
     -  `fedify.queue.task.in_flight` (up/down counter, process local)

    Instruments carry `fedify.queue.role`, best-effort
    `fedify.queue.backend` (the queue implementation's constructor name),
    and `fedify.queue.native_retrial`.  The enqueue/started/completed/
    failed/duration instruments additionally carry
    `activitypub.activity.type` whenever Fedify knows the activity type
    for the queued message; the in-flight up/down counter deliberately
    omits per-message attributes so that increment and decrement
    operations always pair up cleanly per attribute series.  Enqueue
    measurements additionally carry `fedify.queue.task.attempt` for
    retries, and the completion-side instruments carry
    `fedify.queue.task.result` (`completed`, `failed`, or `aborted`).
    Together with `MessageQueue.getDepth()` reporting, these metrics let
    operators distinguish a slow-draining queue from a queue that sees
    less traffic.  [[#316], [#740], [#759]]

 -  Added OpenTelemetry metrics for ActivityPub fanout and activity
    lifecycle events, complementing the per-recipient
    `activitypub.delivery.*` counters and the per-task
    `fedify.queue.task.*` metrics with an activity-level view of inbox
    and outbox pressure:

     -  `activitypub.fanout.recipients` (histogram) records the number of
        recipient inboxes produced by a single fanout enqueue.
     -  `activitypub.inbox.activity` (counter) classifies an inbound
        activity via the new `activitypub.processing.result` attribute
        as `queued`, `processed`, `retried`, `rejected`, or `abandoned`.
     -  `activitypub.outbox.activity` (counter) classifies an outbound
        activity as `queued`, `retried`, or `abandoned`.  Per-recipient
        `sent`/`failed` rows remain on `activitypub.delivery.sent` and
        `activitypub.delivery.permanent_failure` and are not duplicated.

    The lifecycle counters cover only Fedify-managed events: queue
    backends with `nativeRetrial` defer retry handling and therefore do
    not record `retried` or `abandoned`.  Recipient URLs, actor IDs,
    and other high-cardinality identifiers are deliberately excluded
    from the fanout histogram.  [[#316], [#742], [#770]]

 -  Added OpenTelemetry metrics for public key lookups, remote JSON-LD
    document fetches, and `lookupObject()` calls so operators can
    observe how often Fedify hits the cache, how long remote fetches
    take, and how `lookupObject()` resolutions split between actors,
    non-actor objects, and unresolved lookups:

     -  `activitypub.key.lookup` (counter) and
        `activitypub.key.lookup.duration` (histogram) cover every
        public key lookup performed by `fetchKey()` /
        `fetchKeyDetailed()`, including signature verification paths.
     -  `activitypub.document.fetch` (counter) and
        `activitypub.document.fetch.duration` (histogram) cover every
        Fedify-wrapped document or context loader invocation, including
        the authenticated loader.
     -  `activitypub.document.cache` (counter) records `hit` or `miss`
        for each `kvCache()`-backed cache lookup.
     -  `activitypub.object.lookup` (counter) records the
        parsed-result classification of every `lookupObject()` call as
        `actor`, `object`, or `other`.

    Instruments share an `activitypub.lookup.kind` and (where
    applicable) `activitypub.lookup.result` attribute drawn from small,
    spec-bounded enumerations.  `activitypub.remote.host` records the
    URL host, including any non-default port; `http.response.status_code`
    is recorded when an HTTP response was observed;
    `activitypub.cache.enabled` is recorded on the key and document
    fetch metrics whenever Fedify can confidently report the cache
    layer's presence.  Key IDs, actor
    IDs, object IDs, JSON-LD context URLs, full URLs, and fediverse
    handles are deliberately excluded so attacker-controlled remotes
    cannot inflate metric cardinality.  The existing
    `activitypub.signature.key_fetch.duration` histogram (introduced in
    Fedify 2.3 for signature-scoped key-fetch latency, sliced by
    `activitypub.signature.kind`) remains in place; the new
    `activitypub.key.lookup.duration` is the general-purpose
    histogram that covers non-signature key fetches as well and adds
    `http.response.status_code` and a richer
    `activitypub.lookup.result` taxonomy.  [[#316], [#738], [#771]]

 -  Added OpenTelemetry metrics for the WebFinger and actor handle
    discovery paths so operators can graph aggregate discovery rate,
    latency, and outcome mix without sampling spans:

     -  `webfinger.lookup` (counter) and `webfinger.lookup.duration`
        (histogram) cover outgoing `lookupWebFinger()` calls.
     -  `webfinger.handle` (counter) and `webfinger.handle.duration`
        (histogram) cover incoming WebFinger requests handled by
        `Federation.fetch()`.
     -  `activitypub.actor.discovery` (counter) and
        `activitypub.actor.discovery.duration` (histogram) cover
        `getActorHandle()` actor handle discovery.

    Each family carries a bounded result attribute
    (`webfinger.lookup.result`, `webfinger.handle.result`, or
    `activitypub.actor.discovery.result`) so operators can slice
    discovery failures by terminal outcome (found / not\_found /
    invalid / network\_error / error for outgoing lookups;
    resolved / invalid / not\_found / tombstoned / error for incoming
    requests; resolved / not\_found / error for actor discovery).
    `webfinger.resource.scheme` is bucketed to a small allow list
    (`acct`, `http`, `https`, `mailto`, or `other`) so an
    attacker-controlled query string cannot inflate metric
    cardinality; `activitypub.remote.host` records the URL host,
    including any non-default port.  Full resource URIs, lookup URLs,
    and handle strings are
    deliberately excluded; they remain on the corresponding spans
    (`webfinger.lookup`, `webfinger.handle`,
    `activitypub.get_actor_handle`) for trace-level investigation.

    `lookupWebFinger()` and `getActorHandle()` follow the opt-in
    `lookupObject()` pattern: omitting the new `meterProvider` option
    emits no measurement.  Applications that pass a `meterProvider`
    to `createFederation()` get the inbound `webfinger.handle` family
    and the federation-bound `Context.lookupWebFinger()` family wired
    up automatically.  Direct `getActorHandle()` calls remain opt-in:
    pass `meterProvider` through `GetActorHandleOptions` to enable
    the discovery metrics, and the option is forwarded into the
    nested WebFinger lookups so one discovery emits both the
    discovery measurement and the underlying `webfinger.lookup`
    measurements (one for the actor ID host, plus a second for the
    alias host when cross-origin verification runs).
    [[#316], [#739], [#772]]

 -  Added an outbound delivery circuit breaker for queued outbox delivery.
    Fedify now tracks consecutive network and HTTP 5xx delivery failures
    per remote host (including any non-default port), stores the state in
    the configured `KvStore`, and requeues messages held by an open circuit
    instead of repeatedly sending to an unreachable server.  The circuit
    breaker is enabled by default for queued outbox delivery and can be
    disabled with
    `circuitBreaker: false`; applications can customize the failure policy,
    recovery delay, held activity TTL, release interval, and state/drop
    callbacks.  HTTP 429 responses do not count as circuit failures and
    `Retry-After` is respected when present.  State changes are exposed
    through `activitypub.circuit_breaker.state_change` metrics and
    `activitypub.circuit_breaker.state_change` span events, and expired
    held activities call the outbox permanent failure handler with
    `reason: "circuit-breaker-ttl"`.  [[#620], [#778]]

 -  Added `benchmarkMode` to `createFederation()` and
    `FederationBuilder.build()` for cooperative federation benchmarking.
    When enabled, Fedify exposes `GET /.well-known/fedify/bench/stats`
    for in-process OpenTelemetry metric snapshots and
    `POST /.well-known/fedify/bench/trigger` for driving `sendActivity()`
    to server-configured benchmark sink recipients.  Benchmark mode also
    defaults `allowPrivateAddress` to `true` when built-in loaders are used,
    defaults `signatureTimeWindow` to `false`, reports queue depth through
    the new `fedify.queue.depth` gauge, and adds explicit low-latency
    buckets to the signature verification duration histogram.
    [[#744], [#782], [#787]]

 -  Replaced Fedify's internal federation routing with
    *@fedify/uri-template* for stricter RFC 6570 URI Template expansion and
    matching.  The deprecated `Router` export from *@fedify/fedify* remains
    available for compatibility.  [[#418], [#758] by ChanHaeng Lee]

 -  Significantly sped up TypeScript type-checking by simplifying the internal
    `path` parameter types of the `setObjectDispatcher()`,
    `setCollectionDispatcher()`, and `setOrderedCollectionDispatcher()` methods.
    These methods previously expanded `path` into thousands of RFC 6570
    template-literal variants, which dominated type-checking time; a full
    codebase type check now completes in roughly 13 seconds instead of around
    99 seconds.  The public dispatcher method signatures and runtime path
    validation are unchanged.  This is a partial fix for [#613] that targets
    the dispatcher overload hot path; other contributors to `check-all` cost
    may remain.  [[#613], [#800] by ChanHaeng Lee]

### @fedify/cli

 -  Added the `--skip-install` option to `fedify init`, following the
    corresponding `@fedify/init` update, which skips automatic dependency
    installation after scaffolding.  [[#720], [#776] by fru1tworld]

 -  Switched Node.js and Bun projects generated by `fedify init` from Biome
    plus ESLint to Oxfmt plus Oxlint.  New projects now get *.oxfmtrc.json*,
    *.oxlintrc.json*, Oxc editor recommendations, and package scripts for
    `format`, `format:check`, and `lint`; the Oxlint config loads Fedify's
    rules through `@fedify/lint/oxlint`.  [[#703], [#818]]

 -  Added the `fedify bench` command for benchmarking Fedify federation
    workloads.  It acts as a synthetic remote actor that drives
    ActivityPub-specific load (signed inbox deliveries and WebFinger lookups)
    against a cooperative `benchmarkMode` target and reports latency,
    throughput, success rate, and errors, reading server-side metrics from the
    target's stats endpoint.  Benchmarks are described by a YAML or JSON
    scenario suite validated against a published JSON Schema, with an `expect`
    block per scenario that gates a run for CI.  The command refuses public
    non-`benchmarkMode` targets without an explicit unsafe override, supports
    discovery-aware `--dry-run` planning, and ships with a local benchmark
    fixture used by the scenario tests.  [[#744], [#783], [#784], [#791]]

 -  Added `actor`, `object`, `fanout`, `failure`, and `mixed` scenario runners
    to `fedify bench`.  Read scenarios can now benchmark actor and object
    document fetches, including authenticated GET requests; fanout scenarios
    drive the benchmark trigger endpoint and wait for queue task drain; failure
    scenarios report expected fault outcomes as successes; and mixed scenarios
    run weighted child scenario blends.  The `collection` scenario type remains
    reserved but not executable.  Fanout and remote failure scenarios can set
    `sinkBase` to generate deterministic benchmark sink inbox URLs for targets
    that keep `triggerSinks` allowlisting enabled.  This change is published
    as benchmark scenario schema version 2.  [[#744], [#785], [#801], [#802]]

 -  Hardened `fedify bench` safety planning and preflight checks.  The command
    now resolves inbox destinations before load generation, treats unreadable
    or malformed resolver output conservatively, applies suite defaults
    consistently, and keeps the local benchmark fixture inside the CLI package
    for regression coverage.  [[#744], [#795]]

 -  Added `fedify bench compare` for CI-friendly performance regression gates.
    The command checks out base and head refs into temporary worktrees, starts
    the benchmark target for each ref, runs the same suite, and fails when the
    head regresses beyond `--max-regression` plus the measured per-run noise
    band.  Benchmark scenarios now run three times by default and aggregate
    repeated runs with median latency/throughput and pessimistic correctness
    results.  This change is published as benchmark report schema version 3
    and comparison report schema version 1.  [[#744], [#786], [#804]]

### @fedify/backfill

 -  Added *@fedify/backfill* for reconstructing ActivityPub conversations.
    It supports [FEP-f228] context collections containing post-like objects or
    `Create` activities, optional reply-tree traversal, ordered hybrid
    strategies, shared safety budgets, deduplication, and traversal-local
    document caching.
    [[#275], [#779], [#801], [#807], [#816], [#820] by Jiwon Kwon]

### @fedify/fixture

 -  Added `createTestMeterProvider()` and `TestMetricRecorder` helpers for
    asserting OpenTelemetry metric measurements in runtime-agnostic tests.
    [[#316], [#619], [#755]]

### @fedify/testing

 -  Added a `meterProvider` option to `createFederation()` so mock contexts can
    expose a test OpenTelemetry meter provider.  [[#316], [#619], [#755]]

### @fedify/uri-template

 -  Added *@fedify/uri-template*, a dependency-free RFC 6570 URI Template
    implementation for expansion, variable extraction, and round-trip route
    matching.  This package replaces Fedify's previous direct use of
    *url-template* and *uri-template-router*.  [[#418], [#758] by ChanHaeng Lee]

### @fedify/amqp

 -  Added `AmqpMessageQueue.getDepth()` for reporting queued, ready, and
    delayed message counts.  Delayed counts include queues created or tracked
    by the same `AmqpMessageQueue` instance.  [[#735], [#748]]

### @fedify/mysql

 -  Added `MysqlMessageQueue.getDepth()` for reporting queued, ready, and
    delayed message counts.  [[#735], [#748]]

### @fedify/postgres

 -  Added `PostgresMessageQueue.getDepth()` for reporting queued, ready, and
    delayed message counts.  [[#735], [#748]]

### @fedify/redis

 -  Added `RedisMessageQueue.getDepth()` for reporting queued, ready, and
    delayed message counts.  [[#735], [#748]]

### @fedify/sqlite

 -  Added `SqliteMessageQueue.getDepth()` for reporting queued, ready, and
    delayed message counts.  [[#735], [#748]]

### @fedify/init

 -  Added a `--skip-install` option to `fedify init` that skips automatic
    dependency installation after scaffolding.  This is useful for CI
    environments, monorepo workspaces that install dependencies from the
    root, or when you want to inspect the generated files before
    installing.  [[#720], [#776] by fru1tworld]

 -  Switched generated Node.js and Bun projects from Biome plus ESLint to
    Oxfmt plus Oxlint.  New projects now get *.oxfmtrc.json*,
    *.oxlintrc.json*, Oxc editor recommendations, and package scripts for
    `format`, `format:check`, and `lint`; the Oxlint config loads Fedify's
    rules through `@fedify/lint/oxlint`.  [[#703], [#818]]

### @fedify/lint

 -  Added official Oxlint support through a new `@fedify/lint/oxlint` subpath
    export, which exposes Fedify's lint rules in the shape Oxlint's JS plugin
    API expects.  Previously, using `@fedify/lint` from Oxlint required a local
    wrapper module to re-export the plugin object as the default export; the new
    entrypoint removes that friction.  The rules are reused verbatim from the
    ESLint plugin, and the existing Deno and ESLint root exports are unchanged.
    Note that Oxlint's JS plugin support is still alpha upstream.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added `PropertyPreprocessor`, `PropertyPreprocessorContext`, and `Json`
    types for normalizing wire-level JSON-LD property values before the
    generated range decoder runs.  [[#792]]

[#792]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/792

### @fedify/vocab

 -  Explicit ActivityStreams `Link` objects in `icon` and `image` properties
    are now normalized to `Image` during decoding via the new exported
    `normalizeLinkToImage()` preprocessor.  The public `Image`-oriented
    TypeScript API is unchanged.  [[#790], [#792]]

 -  The generated `fromJsonLd()` methods no longer resolve blank node
    identifiers (`_:b0`) against `options.baseUrl`; blank nodes are left
    as `null` in the resulting instance's `id` field.  [[#792]]

 -  Added the second-stage vocabulary types for [FEP-0837], economic
    resource coordination in federated networks.
    [[#775], [#817] by Samuel Brinkmann]

     -  Added `Agreement` class, representing the agreement reached between
        parties responding to a `Proposal`, wrapped in an `Offer` and
        finalized as the `result` of an `Accept`.
     -  Added `Commitment` class, representing a promised economic
        transaction that references an `Intent` via `satisfies` and carries
        the committed quantity via `resourceQuantity`.

[#790]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/790
[#817]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/817

### @fedify/vocab-tools

 -  Property schemas now support a `preprocessors` field that lists
    module/function pairs.  Generated decoders statically import and run
    these preprocessors for each expanded JSON-LD property value before
    falling back to the normal range decoder.  [[#792]]

 -  The generated base class now stores the `baseUrl` from `fromJsonLd()`
    as a protected `_baseUrl` field.  This URL is used to resolve
    relative URIs when cached embedded property documents are re-parsed
    lazily by accessors like `getIcon()`, so that callers do not need to
    pass an explicit `baseUrl`.  The stored URL is defensively copied so
    that mutation of the caller's original `URL` object does not affect
    later resolution.  [[#792]]

### Documentation and examples

 -  Rebuilt the documentation home page on VitePress 2 with a custom Fedify
    landing page, package-manager-specific installation commands, richer
    feature sections, linked fediverse software logos, Sovereign Tech Agency
    credit, and a generated Open Graph image.  [[#809]]

 -  Added a production monitoring guide that turns Fedify's OpenTelemetry
    metrics into practical Prometheus queries, dashboard panels, and alerting
    rules for federation health, queue backlog, delivery failures, signature
    verification failures, and circuit breaker state.  [[#813]]

 -  Added a runnable monitoring example at *examples/monitoring/* with an
    OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Grafana dashboard provisioning,
    Prometheus alert rules, synthetic Fedify-shaped metrics, validation
    checks, and an optional Docker Compose smoke test.  [[#814]]

### Claude Code plugin

 -  Added a Claude Code plugin at *claude-plugin/*, installable with:

    ~~~~ text
    /plugin marketplace add fedify-dev/fedify
    /plugin install fedify@fedify
    ~~~~

    The plugin provides six slash commands (`/fedify:fedify`, `/fedify:docs`,
    `/fedify:actor`, `/fedify:inbox`, `/fedify:migration`, `/fedify:fep`) and
    two specialized
    agents (`fedify-reviewer` and `fedify-debugger`).  The Agent Skills bundle
    lives canonically in *claude-plugin/skills/fedify/* and is referenced from
    *packages/fedify/skills/fedify/* via a symlink; the `prepack` script
    resolves the symlink to real files before packing so the published npm
    tarball is self-contained.  [[#489], [#756]]

Version 2.2.11
--------------

Released on August 23, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed some public relay subscription requests being rejected by
    implementations that compare `Follow.object` as a plain URL without JSON-LD
    expansion.  The Public collection in relay `Follow` activities is now
    serialized as its full ActivityStreams URI instead of a compact IRI.
    [[#998], [#1008] by Jiwon Kwon\]

### @fedify/cli

 -  Added a permanent removal warning to the `fedify init` command for Linux
    and other Unix-like system users before deleting existing content in the
    project directory.
    [[#989], [#997] by Jungmin Yoon\]

### @fedify/init

 -  Added permanent removal warning for Linux or other UNIX-like system users
    before delete the existing content in the project directory.
    [[#989], [#997] by Jungmin Yoon\]

### @fedify/lint

 -  Fixed `@fedify/lint` actor property requirement rules reporting false
    positives when an actor dispatcher returns `null` for an actor that was not
    found.  Non-null actor returns are still checked for the configured
    properties.  [[#974]]

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added the [Controlled Identifiers v1.0] context to the preloaded JSON-LD
    contexts.  The default document loader now resolves
    <https://www.w3.org/ns/cid/v1> locally, so transient W3C outages no longer
    prevent otherwise valid inbound documents from being parsed or verified.
    [[#932]]


Version 2.2.10
--------------

Released on August 22, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in authenticated
    document loaders, where an otherwise public document URL could redirect a
    signed request to a loopback, link-local, or private address.  Redirect
    targets are now validated before they are fetched, while the explicit
    `allowPrivateAddress` option continues to permit private addresses.
    [[CVE-2026-77632] by Jace\]
 -  Standalone key documents whose `id` differs from the requested key URL are
    now rejected instead of being cached under the wrong URL.
    [[#963], [#980] by Junseok Oh\]

### @fedify/elysia

 -  Fixed duplicate response headers on Elysia 1.4.18 and earlier, which
    append both `set.headers` and the returned `Response`'s own headers
    without deduplication.  The `fedify()` plugin no longer sets the headers
    in both places.
    [[#970], [#972] by Kyujin Lim\]

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added the [FEP-ef61] context to preloaded JSON-LD contexts.  The
    <https://w3id.org/fep/ef61> URL redirects to a Codeberg Pages host which
    suffers recurring outages; during one, JSON-LD expansion of any document
    referencing this URL fails before application handlers can run.
    [[#982], [#928]]
 -  Changed `miscellany` context to match public version 1.0.1,
    which fixes a bug with re-compacting Mastodon and similar content using
    `boolean` flags (`manuallyApprovesFollowers`, `sensitive`).
    [[#1002], [#1003] by Evan Prodromou\]


Version 2.2.9
-------------

Released on July 29, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added <https://purl.archive.org/miscellany> (the
    [SWICG ActivityPub Miscellaneous Terms] context, referenced by every Bridgy
    Fed activity) to preloaded JSON-LD contexts.  The context is served through
    purl.archive.org, which suffers recurring outages; during one, JSON-LD
    expansion of any activity referencing this URL fails before application
    handlers can run. [[#965] by Michael Barrett]


Version 2.2.8
-------------

Released on July 19, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Fixed document loaders rejecting public URLs backed by CNAMEs on
    Cloudflare Workers.  `validatePublicUrl()` now ignores non-IP aliases
    returned alongside DNS lookup results while continuing to validate every
    resolved IP address, and rejects lookups that return no IP addresses.
    [[#956], [#957] by SJang1]

### @fedify/cfworkers

 -  Fixed `WorkersMessageQueue.enqueueMany()` failing when the given messages
    exceeded Cloudflare Queues' batch limits of 100 messages or 256 KB per
    batch, which could happen when delivering activities to a large audience.
    The method now estimates the serialized size of each message and splits
    the messages into multiple `sendBatch()` calls that stay within the
    limits.  [[#958], [#960] by SJang1]


Version 2.2.7
-------------

Released on July 15, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the
    `getNodeInfo()` function and the `Context.lookupNodeInfo()` method, where
    the NodeInfo document URL advertised in a remote server's
    `/.well-known/nodeinfo` response was fetched without checking that it
    points to a public address.  A malicious server could direct the link to
    a loopback, link-local, or private address—or to a `data:` URL—causing
    Fedify to fetch internal resources and return their contents to the
    caller.  Both requests, including any redirect hops, are now validated
    against private and non-public addresses, consistent with the protections
    already applied to WebFinger lookups and the built-in document loader.
    [[CVE-2026-62857]]

 -  Fixed custom collection dispatchers registered through
    `FederationBuilder.setCollectionDispatcher()` and
    `setOrderedCollectionDispatcher()` returning `404 Not Found` after
    `build()`.  `build()` now copies the collection callbacks and item types
    onto the built federation, so the registered routes dispatch their
    collections instead of being treated as unknown routes.
    [[#849], [#851] by ChanHaeng Lee]

 -  Fixed split-origin WebFinger responses for `acct:` aliases on the web
    origin host.  When a local actor is queried through the server-origin
    `acct:` alias, Fedify now returns the canonical handle-host `acct:` URI as
    the JRD `subject` and keeps the queried `acct:` URI in `aliases`.
    [[#920], [#921]]

### @fedify/vocab

 -  Fixed Activity Vocabulary parsing so malformed language tags in remote
    JSON-LD language maps no longer abort parsing with a `RangeError`.  Fedify
    now ignores only the malformed language-tagged value and continues parsing
    the rest of the object.  [[#847], [#848]]

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify nodeinfo` choosing SVG favicons whose filenames use
    uppercase `.SVG` extensions or include query strings or fragments.  The
    command now ignores those SVG favicon links and falls back to
    `/favicon.ico` before rendering terminal art.
    [[#891], [#918] by Junghoon Ban]


Version 2.2.6
-------------

Released on June 27, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed outbound activity delivery aborting when Linked Data Signatures
    creation fails during JSON-LD canonicalization.  Fedify now logs the
    signing failure and continues delivery without the Linked Data Signature
    for JSON-LD processing failures, while still surfacing key, configuration,
    and programming errors from signing.  [[#824], [#842] by Lee ByeongJun]

 -  Fixed inbox verification crashing when a remote actor document contains a
    malformed `publicKey` entry.  Fedify now treats the malformed key as a
    failed key lookup so HTTP Signatures verification fails normally instead of
    returning a server error.  [[#825], [#844] by Lee ByeongJun]


Version 2.2.5
-------------

Released on June 5, 2026.

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify` command failing under Deno 2.8+/TypeScript 6.0 where
    `setTimeout()` returns `Timeout` instead of `number`.  Used
    `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>` for the `signalTimers` WeakMap so it
    is compatible across all TypeScript/Deno versions.  [[#789] by Rui Chen]

[#789]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/789


Version 2.2.4
-------------

Released on June 4, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing special-use IPv4 ranges, such as
    shared address space, benchmarking, multicast, reserved, and documentation
    ranges, which could bypass private network protections in remote document
    loading.  [[CVE-2026-50131]]

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing IPv6 translation and tunneling
    prefixes, including NAT64, Teredo, and 6to4 addresses, which could bypass
    private network protections in remote document loading.  [[CVE-2026-50131]]

[CVE-2026-50131]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/security/advisories/GHSA-xw9q-2mv6-9fr8


Version 2.2.3
-------------

Released on May 21, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a security vulnerability in Linked Data Signature verification that
    could allow certain signed activities to be interpreted differently than
    intended.  [[CVE-2026-42462]]

[CVE-2026-42462]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/security/advisories/GHSA-9rfg-v8g9-9367


Version 2.2.2
-------------

Released on May 15, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `doubleKnock()` so transient transport failures such as DNS hiccups
    no longer leak raw `TypeError`s.  Idempotent authenticated document
    fetches are retried once, and remaining transport failures are reported as
    `FetchError` with the original error as the cause.  [[#762], [#763]]

 -  Fixed a `TypeError` thrown when Activity Vocabulary constructors received
    a `Temporal.Instant` or `Temporal.Duration` produced by an implementation
    other than the bundled `@js-temporal/polyfill` (for example, the native
    `Temporal` shipped with Node.js 26+).  Internal `instanceof` checks have
    been replaced with `Symbol.toStringTag`-based guards so any spec-conformant
    Temporal value is accepted.  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer
    import from `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal`
    namespace through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, which removes the
    nominal mismatch with native Temporal types.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is
    required to consume the type declarations.  [[#767], [#768]]

[#767]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/767
[#768]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/768

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added `isTemporalInstant()` and `isTemporalDuration()` type guards that
    accept both polyfill and native `Temporal` values via `Symbol.toStringTag`.
    [[#767], [#768]]

 -  Added the `@fedify/vocab-runtime/temporal` subpath export so consumers
    can import the new `Temporal` type guards without pulling in the rest of
    the runtime.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/postgres

 -  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer import from
    `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal` namespace
    through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, so `pollInterval` and
    `handlerTimeout` accept native `Temporal.Duration` values from Node.js
    26+ without a nominal type mismatch.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is
    required to consume the type declarations.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/redis

 -  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer import from
    `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal` namespace
    through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, so `pollInterval` accepts
    native `Temporal.Duration` values from Node.js 26+ without a nominal type
    mismatch.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is required to consume the type
    declarations.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/sqlite

 -  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer import from
    `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal` namespace
    through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, so `pollInterval` accepts
    native `Temporal.Duration` values from Node.js 26+ without a nominal type
    mismatch.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is required to consume the type
    declarations.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/mysql

 -  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer import from
    `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal` namespace
    through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, so `pollInterval` and
    `handlerTimeout` accept native `Temporal.Duration` values from Node.js
    26+ without a nominal type mismatch.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is
    required to consume the type declarations.  [[#767]]


Version 2.2.1
-------------

Released on May 10, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing private IPv4 addresses encoded as
    IPv4-mapped IPv6 URL literals, such as `http://[::ffff:7f00:1]/`, which
    could bypass private network protections in remote document loading.


Version 2.2.0
-------------

Released on April 28, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Shipped an [Agent Skills] bundle at *skills/fedify/* and declared it in
    *package.json* through the `agents.skills` field.  The skill teaches AI
    coding agents how to *use* Fedify inside a consumer's project (builder
    pattern, dispatchers, framework integrations, vocabulary, keys, queues
    and storage, observability, CLI, and common pitfalls).  Projects that
    run a tool implementing the Agent Skills spec, such as [skills-npm],
    will pick up the skill automatically from *node\_modules*, keeping the
    guidance in sync with the installed Fedify version.  [[#711], [#712]]

 -  Added `setOutboxListeners()` and `OutboxContext` for handling
    client-to-server `POST` requests to actor outboxes.  Outbox listeners use
    application-defined authorization through `.authorize()`, catch activity
    types with `.on()`, and require explicit delivery through
    `ctx.sendActivity()` or `ctx.forwardActivity()`.  Fedify now also logs a
    runtime warning when an outbox listener returns without delivering the
    posted activity.
    [[#430], [#688]]

 -  Allowed actor dispatchers to return `Tombstone` for deleted accounts.
    Fedify now serves those actor URIs as `410 Gone` with the serialized
    tombstone body, and the corresponding WebFinger lookups also return
    `410 Gone` instead of pretending the account was never handled.
    Added a `RequestContext.getActor()` overload that can return those
    tombstones to application code when called with
    `{ tombstone: "passthrough" }`.
    [[#644], [#680]]

 -  Added `DoubleKnockOptions.maxRedirection` to configure the maximum number
    of redirects followed by `doubleKnock()`.
    `getAuthenticatedDocumentLoader()` now also respects
    `GetAuthenticatedDocumentLoaderOptions.maxRedirection`.

 -  Improved interoperability with threadiverse software by serializing the
    public audience as the full `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public`
    URI in outgoing activities' `to`, `cc`, `bto`, `bcc`, and `audience`
    fields, instead of the compacted `as:Public` or `Public` CURIEs that
    JSON-LD compaction would otherwise produce.  Some ActivityPub
    implementations, [Lemmy] included, match those fields as plain URLs
    without JSON-LD expansion and would silently drop activities carrying
    the CURIE form; see [LemmyNet/lemmy#6465].  The rewrite is gated on a
    URDNA2015 canonical-form equivalence check, so an application-defined
    `@context` that redefines the `as:` prefix or the bare `Public` term
    is preserved as is.  The rewrite is also applied before
    `eddsa-jcs-2022` Object Integrity Proof signing so the signed bytes
    match what is sent on the wire.  [[#710], [#721]]

 -  Improved interoperability with [Pixelfed] by serializing outgoing
    activities' `attachment` fields as arrays even when there is only one
    attachment.  JSON-LD compaction would otherwise emit a scalar value for
    single attachments, but Pixelfed currently expects an array and may reject
    incoming posts; see [pixelfed/pixelfed#6588].  [[#721]]

### @fedify/lint

 -  Added the `outbox-listener-delivery-required` rule.  It warns when an
    outbox listener registered through `setOutboxListeners()` returns without an
    explicit delivery call, which would otherwise leave a posted client
    activity unfederated.  [[#430], [#688]]

### @fedify/testing

 -  Added `createOutboxContext()` plus `postOutboxActivity()` and mock
    `setOutboxListeners()` support so outbox listeners using either
    `sendActivity()` or `forwardActivity()` can be tested without spinning up
    a live federation server.  [[#430], [#688]]

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added `DocumentLoaderFactoryOptions.maxRedirection` to configure the
    maximum number of redirects followed by `getDocumentLoader()`.

### @fedify/vocab

 -  Added `Tombstone.formerType` plus generated entity type helpers for deleted
    vocabulary objects.  Applications can now construct tombstones with Fedify
    entity classes such as `Person`, and `@fedify/vocab` now exports
    `$EntityType`, `isEntityType()`, and `getEntityTypeById()` for working with
    those references.  Unknown remote `formerType` values are ignored with a
    warning instead of making the whole tombstone fail to parse.
    [[#645], [#681]]

 -  Added [FEP-044f] vocabulary support for Mastodon-style quote posts.
    [[#452], [#679]]

     -  Added `QuoteRequest` and `QuoteAuthorization` classes.
     -  Added `canQuote` to `InteractionPolicy`.
     -  Added `quote` and `quoteAuthorization` properties to `Article`,
        `ChatMessage`, `Note`, and `Question`.

 -  Added vocabulary types for [FEP-0837], economic resource coordination
    in federated networks.  [[#578] by Samuel Brinkmann]

     -  Added `Proposal` class for publishing offers or requests.
     -  Added `Intent` class for describing economic transactions within
        a proposal, with `action`, `resourceConformsTo`, `resourceQuantity`,
        `availableQuantity`, and `minimumQuantity` properties.
     -  Added `Measure` class for representing quantities with units of
        measure, with `unit` and `numericalValue` properties.

[#681]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/681

### @fedify/vocab-tools

 -  Added the `fedify:vocabEntityType` pseudo-scalar to the vocabulary
    generator.  Vocabulary properties can now accept generated Fedify entity
    constructors instead of arbitrary IRIs when the schema wants a reference to
    a known vocabulary type.  Generated code now also emits the supporting
    `$EntityType`, `isEntityType()`, and `getEntityTypeById()` helpers for
    working with those references.  [[#645], [#681]]

### @fedify/cli

 -  Made `fedify lookup --recurse` honor `-p`/`--allow-private-address`
    for recursively discovered object URLs, matching the policy already used
    by `-t`/`--traverse`.  Recursive lookups still reject private or
    localhost targets by default unless users explicitly opt in.
    [[#700], [#718]]

 -  Added [FEP-044f] `quote` support to `fedify lookup --recurse`, so the CLI
    can follow both the new quote-post relation and the older `quoteUrl`
    compatibility surface.  [[#452], [#679]]

[#700]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/700
[#718]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/718

### @fedify/solidstart

 -  Added `@fedify/solidstart` package for integrating Fedify with
    [SolidStart].  It provides `fedifyMiddleware()` for request handling
    with SolidStart's middleware system.
    [[#476], [#601] by Hyeonseo Kim and [#652] by ChanHaeng Lee]

[#652]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/652

### @fedify/nuxt

 -  Added `@fedify/nuxt` package for integrating Fedify with [Nuxt].
    It provides a Nuxt module that delegates non-federation requests to Nuxt,
    supports shared-route content negotiation, and returns deferred
    `406 Not Acceptable` when Fedify routes are requested without
    ActivityPub-compatible `Accept` headers and Nuxt has no matching page.

[#149]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/149
[#674]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/674

### @fedify/init

 -  Added a `--allow-non-empty` option to `fedify init` for automated
    scaffolding in directories that already contain unrelated files.  The
    command still fails before making changes if any file that Fedify would
    generate already exists, avoiding accidental merges or appends.
    [[#716], [#717]]

 -  Fixed `fedify init` so that a directory containing only a freshly
    initialized Git repository is treated as empty.  Directories whose Git
    `HEAD` already resolves to a commit, whose Git metadata contains loose or
    packed refs, stored objects, an index, or reflogs, or that contain any
    files besides *.git*, still require the existing non-empty-directory
    confirmation.  [[#716], [#717]]

 -  Fixed generated *biome.json* files to use Biome 2 configuration syntax,
    matching the `@biomejs/biome` version that `fedify init` installs.
    Generated projects now enable import organization through Biome's
    `assist.actions.source.organizeImports` setting instead of the removed
    top-level `organizeImports` option.  [[#716], [#717]]

 -  Fixed errors when using `fedify init` with certain web framework
    integration packages (Astro, ElysiaJS, Nitro) alongside `@fedify/mysql`.
    Environment variables are now properly loaded at runtime, resolving the
    `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined` from `mysql2`.
    [[#649], [#656] by ChanHaeng Lee]

 -  Supported [Nuxt] as a web framework option in `fedify init`, with
    templates for federation setup, logging, and Nitro middleware.

### Docs

 -  Added a per-page Markdown action to the docs site so readers can open or
    copy the LLM-friendly Markdown for the current page without guessing the
    generated `*.md` path or starting from *llms.txt*.  The action is now
    available directly from each documentation page while *llms.txt* and
    *llms-full.txt* continue to exclude high-noise pages such as the changelog,
    contribution guide, *README.md*, and sponsors page.  [[#706], [#715]]

 -  Added [*Building a federated blog* tutorial] showing how to layer
    ActivityPub federation onto an [Astro] + [Bun] blog: actor setup,
    follower management, SQLite persistence, sending `Create`/`Update`/
    `Delete(Article)` activities on server startup, and receiving
    `Create`/`Update`/`Delete(Note)` inbox activities as comments.
    [[#691], [#695]]

 -  Added a new tutorial, [*Building a threadiverse community platform*], that
    walks through building a Lemmy-style community server with Fedify and
    Next.js.  Where the existing [*Creating your own federated microblog*]
    tutorial is actor- and timeline-centric, this one is community-centric: it
    models communities as `Group` actors, threads as `Page` objects wrapped in
    `Create`, replies as `Note` objects, and the community-side `Announce`
    redistribution that threadiverse software (Lemmy, Mbin, NodeBB) uses to fan
    activity out to every subscriber.  [[#704], [#710]]

 -  Added [*Creating an image sharing service* tutorial], a Pixelfed-style
    image-sharing companion to the microblog walk-through.  Built on Nuxt 4
    and the new `@fedify/nuxt` integration, the tutorial covers actor
    dispatchers, key pairs, follow/unfollow flows, image-bearing
    `Create(Note)` fan-out and reception, an outbound `Like`/`Undo(Like)`
    heart toggle, and threaded comments through `inReplyTo`.  The
    [companion example repository] keeps one commit per chapter at the
    bottom of its log, with a few rehearsal-driven follow-ups landed on top,
    and the federation flows are demonstrated against both Mastodon and
    Pixelfed.  [[#693]]

 -  Added a custom collections cookbook example for bookmark-like data,
    demonstrating cursor pagination, URI-template filtering, collection
    counters, actor stream links, and requester-aware collections using
    `ctx.getSignedKeyOwner()`.  [[#694], [#722]]

Version 2.1.22
--------------

Released on August 23, 2026.

### @fedify/cli

 -  Added a permanent removal warning to the `fedify init` command for Linux
    and other Unix-like system users before deleting existing content in the
    project directory.
    [[#989], [#997] by Jungmin Yoon\]

### @fedify/init

 -  Added permanent removal warning for Linux or other UNIX-like system users
    before delete the existing content in the project directory.
    [[#989], [#997] by Jungmin Yoon\]

### @fedify/lint

 -  Fixed `@fedify/lint` actor property requirement rules reporting false
    positives when an actor dispatcher returns `null` for an actor that was not
    found.  Non-null actor returns are still checked for the configured
    properties.  [[#974]]

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added the [Controlled Identifiers v1.0] context to the preloaded JSON-LD
    contexts.  The default document loader now resolves
    <https://www.w3.org/ns/cid/v1> locally, so transient W3C outages no longer
    prevent otherwise valid inbound documents from being parsed or verified.
    [[#932]]


Version 2.1.21
--------------

Released on August 22, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in authenticated
    document loaders, where an otherwise public document URL could redirect a
    signed request to a loopback, link-local, or private address.  Redirect
    targets are now validated before they are fetched, while the explicit
    `allowPrivateAddress` option continues to permit private addresses.
    [[CVE-2026-77632] by Jace\]
 -  Standalone key documents whose `id` differs from the requested key URL are
    now rejected instead of being cached under the wrong URL.
    [[#963], [#980] by Junseok Oh\]

### @fedify/elysia

 -  Fixed duplicate response headers on Elysia 1.4.18 and earlier, which
    append both `set.headers` and the returned `Response`'s own headers
    without deduplication.  The `fedify()` plugin no longer sets the headers
    in both places.
    [[#970], [#972] by Kyujin Lim\]

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added the [FEP-ef61] context to preloaded JSON-LD contexts.  The
    <https://w3id.org/fep/ef61> URL redirects to a Codeberg Pages host which
    suffers recurring outages; during one, JSON-LD expansion of any document
    referencing this URL fails before application handlers can run.
    [[#982], [#928]]
 -  Changed `miscellany` context to match public version 1.0.1,
    which fixes a bug with re-compacting Mastodon and similar content using
    `boolean` flags (`manuallyApprovesFollowers`, `sensitive`).
    [[#1002], [#1003] by Evan Prodromou\]


Version 2.1.20
--------------

Released on July 29, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added <https://purl.archive.org/miscellany> (the
    [SWICG ActivityPub Miscellaneous Terms] context, referenced by every Bridgy
    Fed activity) to preloaded JSON-LD contexts.  The context is served through
    purl.archive.org, which suffers recurring outages; during one, JSON-LD
    expansion of any activity referencing this URL fails before application
    handlers can run. [[#965] by Michael Barrett]


Version 2.1.19
--------------

Released on July 19, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Fixed document loaders rejecting public URLs backed by CNAMEs on
    Cloudflare Workers.  `validatePublicUrl()` now ignores non-IP aliases
    returned alongside DNS lookup results while continuing to validate every
    resolved IP address, and rejects lookups that return no IP addresses.
    [[#956], [#957] by SJang1]

### @fedify/cfworkers

 -  Fixed `WorkersMessageQueue.enqueueMany()` failing when the given messages
    exceeded Cloudflare Queues' batch limits of 100 messages or 256 KB per
    batch, which could happen when delivering activities to a large audience.
    The method now estimates the serialized size of each message and splits
    the messages into multiple `sendBatch()` calls that stay within the
    limits.  [[#958], [#960] by SJang1]


Version 2.1.18
--------------

Released on July 15, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the
    `getNodeInfo()` function and the `Context.lookupNodeInfo()` method, where
    the NodeInfo document URL advertised in a remote server's
    `/.well-known/nodeinfo` response was fetched without checking that it
    points to a public address.  A malicious server could direct the link to
    a loopback, link-local, or private address—or to a `data:` URL—causing
    Fedify to fetch internal resources and return their contents to the
    caller.  Both requests, including any redirect hops, are now validated
    against private and non-public addresses, consistent with the protections
    already applied to WebFinger lookups and the built-in document loader.
    [[CVE-2026-62857]]

 -  Fixed custom collection dispatchers registered through
    `FederationBuilder.setCollectionDispatcher()` and
    `setOrderedCollectionDispatcher()` returning `404 Not Found` after
    `build()`.  `build()` now copies the collection callbacks and item types
    onto the built federation, so the registered routes dispatch their
    collections instead of being treated as unknown routes.
    [[#849], [#851] by ChanHaeng Lee]

 -  Fixed split-origin WebFinger responses for `acct:` aliases on the web
    origin host.  When a local actor is queried through the server-origin
    `acct:` alias, Fedify now returns the canonical handle-host `acct:` URI as
    the JRD `subject` and keeps the queried `acct:` URI in `aliases`.
    [[#920], [#921]]

### @fedify/vocab

 -  Fixed Activity Vocabulary parsing so malformed language tags in remote
    JSON-LD language maps no longer abort parsing with a `RangeError`.  Fedify
    now ignores only the malformed language-tagged value and continues parsing
    the rest of the object.  [[#847], [#848]]

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify nodeinfo` choosing SVG favicons whose filenames use
    uppercase `.SVG` extensions or include query strings or fragments.  The
    command now ignores those SVG favicon links and falls back to
    `/favicon.ico` before rendering terminal art.
    [[#891], [#918] by Junghoon Ban]


Version 2.1.17
--------------

Released on June 27, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed outbound activity delivery aborting when Linked Data Signatures
    creation fails during JSON-LD canonicalization.  Fedify now logs the
    signing failure and continues delivery without the Linked Data Signature
    for JSON-LD processing failures, while still surfacing key, configuration,
    and programming errors from signing.  [[#824], [#842] by Lee ByeongJun]

 -  Fixed inbox verification crashing when a remote actor document contains a
    malformed `publicKey` entry.  Fedify now treats the malformed key as a
    failed key lookup so HTTP Signatures verification fails normally instead of
    returning a server error.  [[#825], [#844] by Lee ByeongJun]


Version 2.1.16
--------------

Released on June 5, 2026.

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify` command failing under Deno 2.8+/TypeScript 6.0 where
    `setTimeout()` returns `Timeout` instead of `number`.  Used
    `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>` for the `signalTimers` WeakMap so it
    is compatible across all TypeScript/Deno versions.  [[#789] by Rui Chen]


Version 2.1.15
--------------

Released on June 4, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing special-use IPv4 ranges, such as
    shared address space, benchmarking, multicast, reserved, and documentation
    ranges, which could bypass private network protections in remote document
    loading.  [[CVE-2026-50131]]

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing IPv6 translation and tunneling
    prefixes, including NAT64, Teredo, and 6to4 addresses, which could bypass
    private network protections in remote document loading.  [[CVE-2026-50131]]


Version 2.1.14
--------------

Released on May 21, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a security vulnerability in Linked Data Signature verification that
    could allow certain signed activities to be interpreted differently than
    intended.  [[CVE-2026-42462]]


Version 2.1.13
--------------

Released May 15, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `doubleKnock()` so transient transport failures such as DNS hiccups
    no longer leak raw `TypeError`s.  Idempotent authenticated document
    fetches are retried once, and remaining transport failures are reported as
    `FetchError` with the original error as the cause.  [[#762], [#763]]

 -  Fixed a `TypeError` thrown when Activity Vocabulary constructors received
    a `Temporal.Instant` or `Temporal.Duration` produced by an implementation
    other than the bundled `@js-temporal/polyfill` (for example, the native
    `Temporal` shipped with Node.js 26+).  Internal `instanceof` checks have
    been replaced with `Symbol.toStringTag`-based guards so any spec-conformant
    Temporal value is accepted.  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer
    import from `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal`
    namespace through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, which removes the
    nominal mismatch with native Temporal types.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is
    required to consume the type declarations.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added `isTemporalInstant()` and `isTemporalDuration()` type guards that
    accept both polyfill and native `Temporal` values via `Symbol.toStringTag`.
    [[#767], [#768]]

 -  Added the `@fedify/vocab-runtime/temporal` subpath export so consumers
    can import the new `Temporal` type guards without pulling in the rest of
    the runtime.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/postgres

 -  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer import from
    `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal` namespace
    through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, so `pollInterval` and
    `handlerTimeout` accept native `Temporal.Duration` values from Node.js
    26+ without a nominal type mismatch.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is
    required to consume the type declarations.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/redis

 -  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer import from
    `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal` namespace
    through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, so `pollInterval` accepts
    native `Temporal.Duration` values from Node.js 26+ without a nominal type
    mismatch.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is required to consume the type
    declarations.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/sqlite

 -  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer import from
    `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal` namespace
    through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, so `pollInterval` accepts
    native `Temporal.Duration` values from Node.js 26+ without a nominal type
    mismatch.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is required to consume the type
    declarations.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/mysql

 -  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer import from
    `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal` namespace
    through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, so `pollInterval` and
    `handlerTimeout` accept native `Temporal.Duration` values from Node.js
    26+ without a nominal type mismatch.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is
    required to consume the type declarations.  [[#767]]


Version 2.1.12
--------------

Released on May 10, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing private IPv4 addresses encoded as
    IPv4-mapped IPv6 URL literals, such as `http://[::ffff:7f00:1]/`, which
    could bypass private network protections in remote document loading.


Version 2.1.11
--------------

Released on April 27, 2026.

### @fedify/init

 -  Fixed the Astro, Nitro, and Next.js project templates so their generated
    *logging.ts* files are loaded during server startup before Fedify handles
    requests.  Nitro projects now get a server plugin that imports the LogTape
    configuration, Next.js projects get an *instrumentation.ts* `register()`
    hook that imports it in the Node.js runtime, and Astro projects import it
    in *src/middleware.ts*.  [[#725], [#727]]

[#725]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/725
[#727]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/727


Version 2.1.10
--------------

Released on April 23, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added <https://join-lemmy.org/context.json> to preloaded JSON-LD contexts.
    Lemmy serves this context as `application/json` without a JSON-LD context
    `Link` header, which caused the default document loader to reject
    Lemmy-originated activities before application handlers could run.  [[#714]]

[#714]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/714


Version 2.1.9
-------------

Released on April 22, 2026.

### @fedify/mysql

 -  Fixed a TypeScript type mismatch in `MysqlKvStore` and
    `MysqlMessageQueue` that could reject valid `mysql2` pools when an
    application resolved `mysql2` through multiple type sources or different
    package versions.  The constructors now accept the structural pool shape
    they actually use, so mixed Deno/npm setups and monorepos no longer need
    casts or `@ts-expect-error` workarounds.


Version 2.1.8
-------------

Released on April 22, 2026.

### @fedify/init

 -  Fixed `fedify init -w astro -p bun` generating *package.json* `scripts`
    that invoked Astro through Node.js.  Bun + Astro projects now use
    `bunx --bun astro dev` and `bunx --bun astro build`, so the generated
    development workflow runs on systems that only have Bun installed.

### @fedify/next

 -  Widened `@fedify/next`'s supported Next.js peer dependency range to
    `>=15.4.6 <17`, so installing it into a fresh `create-next-app` 16.x
    project no longer fails with an `ERESOLVE` peer dependency conflict.
    This restores the default `fedify init -w next` flow against the current
    Next.js stable release and updates the integration example to track
    Next.js 16.  [[#713]]

Version 2.1.7
-------------

Released on April 21, 2026.

### @fedify/init

 -  Fixed `fedify init` generating Astro projects for Bun with the Node.js
    adapter and `astro preview`, which could fail to run correctly on Bun.
    Astro + Bun projects now use *@nurodev/astro-bun* and run the built
    Bun server entry point instead.  [[#707]]

Version 2.1.6
-------------

Released on April 20, 2026.

### @fedify/astro

 -  Restored the npm entrypoint contract for `@fedify/astro` by making the
    build emit _dist/\*.js_ and _dist/\*.d.ts_ files that match the published
    package metadata again.  This fixes package resolution failures caused by
    _package.json_ exporting files that did not exist in the npm tarball.

[#699]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/699
[#701]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/701

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify lookup` failing to look up URLs on private or localhost
    addresses unless `-p`/`--allow-private-address` was passed, which was a
    regression introduced in Fedify 2.1.0 when the CLI began forwarding
    the `allowPrivateAddress` option to the underlying document loader.
    URLs explicitly provided on the command line now always allow private
    addresses, while URLs discovered during [`-t`/`--traverse`] honor the
    option to mitigate SSRF attacks against private addresses.  Recursive
    fetches via [`--recurse`] continue to always disallow private
    addresses regardless of the option.  [[#696], [#698] by Chanhaeng Lee]

Version 2.1.5
-------------

Released on April 8, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `Context.getActorKeyPairs()` assigning the same key ID to both
    the `CryptographicKey` (used for HTTP Signatures and Linked Data
    Signatures) and the `Multikey` (used for Object Integrity Proofs) within
    an `ActorKeyPair`.  The `Multikey` now receives a distinct ID
    (`#multikey-1`, `#multikey-2`, …) so that the actor document no longer
    contains two objects sharing the same `id`, which was invalid JSON-LD.
    Object Integrity Proof signatures now reference the correct `Multikey` ID
    instead of the `CryptographicKey` ID.  [[#663]]

 -  Object Integrity Proofs signing now takes place before activity fanout,
    so all recipients receive the same pre-signed activity.  Previously, OIP
    signing was deferred until after fanout, meaning each fanout worker would
    re-sign independently with potentially different timestamps and the fanout
    message itself contained an unsigned activity.

[#663]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/663

### @fedify/cfworkers

 -  Fixed a remaining TypeScript type mismatch for Cloudflare Workers users who
    pass `wrangler types` or `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` generated KV bindings to
    `WorkersKvStore`.  The package now accepts a minimal structural KV binding
    interface for `WorkersKvStore` and `WorkersMessageQueue`'s `orderingKv`
    option instead of requiring the nominal `KVNamespace` type imported from
    `@cloudflare/workers-types`, so generated local declarations compile
    without casts or `@ts-expect-error`.  [[#665]]

[#665]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/665


Version 2.1.4
-------------

Released on April 7, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `sendActivity()` not awaiting `fanoutQueue.enqueue()` in the fanout
    path, which could cause fanout messages to be silently dropped on runtimes
    like Cloudflare Workers that may terminate an isolate as soon as the
    response is sent.  [[#661]]

[#661]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/661

### @fedify/cfworkers

 -  Fixed a TypeScript type mismatch that occurred when passing
    `wrangler types`-generated binding types (e.g. `KVNamespace`, `Queue`)
    to `WorkersKvStore` and `WorkersMessageQueue` constructors.  The package
    previously imported these types from
    `@cloudflare/workers-types/experimental`, which includes extra members
    (such as `KVNamespace.deleteBulk()`) absent from types generated by
    `wrangler types`, causing TypeScript assignment errors at the call site.
    The import now uses the stable `@cloudflare/workers-types` entrypoint,
    whose definitions match what `wrangler types` generates.  [[#662]]

[#662]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/662


Version 2.1.3
-------------

Released on March 31, 2026.

### @fedify/init

 -  Restored the npm entrypoint contract for `@fedify/init` after the `tsdown`
    upgrade started publishing `dist/*.mjs` files while the package metadata
    still exported `dist/*.js` and `dist/*.d.ts`.  Node.js consumers such as
    `@fedify/cli` can start again, including `npx -y @fedify/cli --help`.
    [[#655]]

[#655]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/655

### @fedify/create

 -  Restored the npm CLI entrypoint for `@fedify/create` so the published
    `bin` and `exports` paths once again point to generated `dist/mod.js`
    output instead of missing `dist/mod.js` files.  This prevents the same
    packaging regression from breaking `npm init @fedify`.  [[#655]]


Version 2.1.2
-------------

Released on March 29, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed CommonJS builds of `@fedify/fedify/vocab` missing the `Object`
    export from the entry point.  Older `tsdown` output generated an invalid
    CommonJS re-export, causing `require("@fedify/fedify/vocab").Object` to be
    `undefined`.  Updated the bundler toolchain and added a regression test for
    the built CommonJs entry point.  [[#651]]

[#651]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/651


Version 2.1.1
-------------

Released on March 27, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Limited the number of HTTP redirects followed by the remote document
    loaders and signed HTTP fetches to mitigate resource exhaustion during
    remote key and document resolution.  [[CVE-2026-34148] by Abhinav Jaswal]

 -  Stopped the remote document loaders and signed HTTP fetches from
    revisiting the same URL within a redirect chain, preventing
    self-referential redirect loops.  [[CVE-2026-34148] by Abhinav Jaswal]

 -  Persisted negative public key cache entries for failed remote key
    fetches, reducing repeated retries against the same unavailable key
    across requests.  [[CVE-2026-34148] by Abhinav Jaswal]

[CVE-2026-34148]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/security/advisories/GHSA-gm9m-gwc4-hwgp


Version 2.1.0
-------------

Released on March 24, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Added `InboxListenerSetters.onUnverifiedActivity()` so applications can
    inspect inbound activities whose signatures could not be verified and
    optionally return a custom response instead of the default
    `401 Unauthorized`.  This is useful for cases like `Delete` deliveries
    from actors whose signing keys now return `404 Not Found` or `410 Gone`.
    Added the supporting public types `UnverifiedActivityHandler` and
    `UnverifiedActivityReason`.  [[#472], [#611]]

 -  Added `verifyRequestDetailed()` plus the public types
    `VerifyRequestDetailedResult`, `VerifyRequestFailureReason`, and
    `FetchKeyErrorResult` so applications can distinguish unsigned requests,
    invalid signatures, and key-fetch failures during HTTP signature
    verification.  [[#611]]

 -  OpenTelemetry spans/events and `FedifySpanExporter` signature details now
    expose HTTP signature failure reasons and key-fetch failure details for
    inbound activities.  [[#611]]

 -  Fixed `RequestContext.getSignedKeyOwner()` to return `null` instead of
    throwing an error when the remote server requires authorized fetch and
    returns `401 Unauthorized` for the key owner lookup.  Previously, this
    caused a `500 Internal Server Error` when interoperating with servers like
    GoToSocial that have authorized fetch enabled.  [[#473], [#589]]

 -  Added RFC 9421 §5 `Accept-Signature` negotiation for both outbound and
    inbound paths.  On the outbound side, `doubleKnock()` now parses
    `Accept-Signature` challenges from `401` responses and retries with a
    compatible RFC 9421 signature before falling back to legacy spec-swap.
    On the inbound side, a new `InboxChallengePolicy` option in
    `FederationOptions` enables emitting `Accept-Signature` headers on
    inbox `401` responses, with optional one-time nonce support for replay
    protection.  [[#583], [#584], [#626] by ChanHaeng Lee]

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added `Decimal`, a branded string type for exact `xsd:decimal` values,
    along with `isDecimal()`, `canParseDecimal()`, and `parseDecimal()` for
    checking and validating XML Schema decimal lexical forms without
    introducing a decimal arithmetic dependency.  `isDecimal()` performs a
    strict lexical-form check, while `canParseDecimal()` and `parseDecimal()`
    apply XML Schema whitespace normalization first.  This lays the runtime
    groundwork for precision-safe marketplace and measurement values such as
    those needed by [FEP-0837].  [[#617], [#640]]

 -  Updated the preloaded <https://gotosocial.org/ns> JSON-LD context to
    match the current [GoToSocial] v0.21+ namespace, adding new type terms
    (`LikeRequest`, `LikeAuthorization`, etc.) and property terms
    (`automaticApproval`, `manualApproval`, `interactingObject`, etc.) while
    retaining deprecated terms (`always`, `approvalRequired`) for backward
    compatibility.  [[#453], [#622]]

 -  Added optional `FetchError.response` so callers can inspect the original
    failed HTTP response when remote document or key fetches return an HTTP
    error (such as `404 Not Found` or `410 Gone`).  This enables higher-level
    APIs to distinguish transport failures from specific HTTP fetch failures.

[#640]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/640

### @fedify/cli

 -  Added `--reverse` option to `fedify lookup` to reverse presentation order
    of emitted results.  It now works across default multi-input lookup,
    `--traverse` collection traversal output, and `--recurse` object chains,
    while preserving existing fetch/error semantics.  [[#607], [#609]]

 -  Fixed `fedify lookup` printing separators with extra quotes between
    adjacent objects/items in some output paths (e.g., recurse/traverse
    flows).  Separators are now printed as plain text consistently.
    [[#608]]

 -  Added `--recurse` and `--recurse-depth` options to `fedify lookup` for
    recursively following object relationships (e.g., reply chains via
    `replyTarget` / `inReplyTo`, and quote chains via `quoteUrl` and quote
    IRIs).  `--traverse` and `--recurse` are now mutually exclusive,
    `--recurse-depth` depends on `--recurse`, and `--suppress-errors` now
    works in recurse mode as best-effort lookup.
    [[#606], [#608]]

 -  Hardened `fedify lookup` by disallowing private/localhost document loads
    by default.  For local-development workflows, `-p`/`--allow-private-address`
    (or `lookup.allowPrivateAddress = true` in config) can re-enable private
    address access for explicit lookup/traverse requests.  This option does
    not apply to recursive fetches, which always disallow private addresses.

### @fedify/vocab

 -  Added [GoToSocial] interaction controls vocabulary for expressing who
    can like, reply to, or announce posts and for approving interactions.
    [[#453], [#622]]

     -  Added `InteractionPolicy` and `InteractionRule` typeless value
        classes.
     -  Added `LikeRequest`, `ReplyRequest`, and `AnnounceRequest` activity
        types for requesting interaction approval.
     -  Added `LikeAuthorization`, `ReplyAuthorization`, and
        `AnnounceAuthorization` types for proving approved interactions.
     -  Added `Object.interactionPolicy`, `Object.approvedBy`,
        `Object.getLikeAuthorization()`/`Object.likeAuthorizationId`,
        `Object.getReplyAuthorization()`/`Object.replyAuthorizationId`, and
        `Object.getAnnounceAuthorization()`/`Object.announceAuthorizationId`.

 -  Fixed `Endpoints.toJsonLd()` to no longer emit invalid
    `"type": "as:Endpoints"` in the serialized JSON-LD.  The `as:Endpoints`
    type does not exist in the ActivityStreams vocabulary, and its presence
    caused validation failures on implementations like [browser.pub].
    [[#576]]

 -  Fixed `Source.toJsonLd()` to no longer emit invalid
    `"type": "as:Source"` in the serialized JSON-LD.  The `as:Source` type
    does not exist in the ActivityStreams vocabulary either.

[browser.pub]: https://browser.pub/
[#576]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/576

### @fedify/vocab-tools

 -  Added `xsd:decimal` support to the vocabulary code generator.  Properties
    with that range are now generated as `Decimal` in TypeScript, serialized
    as `xsd:decimal` JSON-LD literals, validated through
    `canParseDecimal()` when checking input data, and normalized through
    `parseDecimal()` when decoded.  Code generation now also rejects property
    ranges that mix `xsd:string` and `xsd:decimal`, since both map to runtime
    strings and would make serialization ambiguous.  [[#617], [#640]]

 -  Added `typeless` field to the type YAML schema.  When set to `true`,
    the generated `toJsonLd()` method does not emit `@type` (or `type` in
    compact form) in the serialized JSON-LD.  This is useful for types
    that are not real vocabulary types but rather anonymous object structures.

### @fedify/init

 -  Changed `fedify init` to add `"temporal"` to `deno.json`'s `"unstable"`
    field only when the installed Deno version is earlier than 2.7.0.
    On Deno 2.7.0 or later, it is no longer added.

 -  `fedify init` now omits the `"unstable"` field entirely when no unstable
    feature is required for the generated Deno project.

 -  Supported [Astro] as a web framework option in `fedify init`, with
    runtime-specific templates for Deno, Bun, and Node.js environments.
    [[#50] by ChanHaeng Lee]

[#50]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/50

### @fedify/astro

 -  Added `@fedify/astro` package for integrating Fedify with [Astro].
    It provides `fedifyIntegration()` for Vite SSR configuration and
    `fedifyMiddleware()` for request handling.  [[#50] by Chanhaeng Lee]

### @fedify/mysql

 -  Added `MysqlMessageQueue` class to the `@fedify/mysql` package, a
    MySQL/MariaDB-backed `MessageQueue` implementation.  It uses periodic
    polling (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`) to deliver messages and
    MySQL advisory locks (`GET_LOCK`/`RELEASE_LOCK`) for ordering-key
    serialization.  Supports delayed delivery, ordering keys,
    `enqueueMany()`, and concurrent workers.  Requires MySQL 8.0+ or
    MariaDB 10.6+.  [[#586], [#599]]

 -  Added `@fedify/mysql` package, a MySQL/MariaDB-backed `KvStore`
    implementation.  It provides `MysqlKvStore`, which stores key–value
    pairs in a MySQL table using the [`mysql2`] driver.  Supports TTL,
    prefix listing, and compare-and-swap (`cas()`) operations.

Version 2.0.26
--------------

Released on August 23, 2026.

### @fedify/cli

 -  Added a permanent removal warning to the `fedify init` command for Linux
    and other Unix-like system users before deleting existing content in the
    project directory. [[#989], [#997] by Jungmin Yoon\]

### @fedify/init

 -  Added permanent removal warning for Linux or other UNIX-like system users
    before delete the existing content in the project directory.
    [[#989], [#997] by Jungmin Yoon\]

### @fedify/lint

 -  Fixed `@fedify/lint` actor property requirement rules reporting false
    positives when an actor dispatcher returns `null` for an actor that was not
    found.  Non-null actor returns are still checked for the configured
    properties.  [[#974]]

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added the [Controlled Identifiers v1.0] context to the preloaded JSON-LD
    contexts.  The default document loader now resolves
    <https://www.w3.org/ns/cid/v1> locally, so transient W3C outages no longer
    prevent otherwise valid inbound documents from being parsed or verified.
    [[#932]]


Version 2.0.25
--------------

Released on August 22, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in authenticated
    document loaders, where an otherwise public document URL could redirect a
    signed request to a loopback, link-local, or private address.  Redirect
    targets are now validated before they are fetched, while the explicit
    `allowPrivateAddress` option continues to permit private addresses.
    [[CVE-2026-77632] by Jace\]
 -  Standalone key documents whose `id` differs from the requested key URL are
    now rejected instead of being cached under the wrong URL.
    [[#963], [#980] by Junseok Oh\]

### @fedify/elysia

 -  Fixed duplicate response headers on Elysia 1.4.18 and earlier, which
    append both `set.headers` and the returned `Response`'s own headers
    without deduplication.  The `fedify()` plugin no longer sets the headers
    in both places.  [[#970], [#972] by Kyujin Lim\]

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added the [FEP-ef61] context to preloaded JSON-LD contexts.  The
    <https://w3id.org/fep/ef61> URL redirects to a Codeberg Pages host which
    suffers recurring outages; during one, JSON-LD expansion of any document
    referencing this URL fails before application handlers can run.
    [[#982], [#928]]
 -  Changed `miscellany` context to match public version 1.0.1,
    which fixes a bug with re-compacting Mastodon and similar content using
    `boolean` flags (`manuallyApprovesFollowers`, `sensitive`).
    [[#1002], [#1003] by Evan Prodromou\]


Version 2.0.24
--------------

Released on July 29, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added <https://purl.archive.org/miscellany> (the
    [SWICG ActivityPub Miscellaneous Terms] context, referenced by every Bridgy
    Fed activity) to preloaded JSON-LD contexts.  The context is served through
    purl.archive.org, which suffers recurring outages; during one, JSON-LD
    expansion of any activity referencing this URL fails before application
    handlers can run. [[#965] by Michael Barrett]


Version 2.0.23
--------------

Released on July 19, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Fixed document loaders rejecting public URLs backed by CNAMEs on
    Cloudflare Workers.  `validatePublicUrl()` now ignores non-IP aliases
    returned alongside DNS lookup results while continuing to validate every
    resolved IP address, and rejects lookups that return no IP addresses.
    [[#956], [#957] by SJang1]

### @fedify/cfworkers

 -  Fixed `WorkersMessageQueue.enqueueMany()` failing when the given messages
    exceeded Cloudflare Queues' batch limits of 100 messages or 256 KB per
    batch, which could happen when delivering activities to a large audience.
    The method now estimates the serialized size of each message and splits
    the messages into multiple `sendBatch()` calls that stay within the
    limits.  [[#958], [#960] by SJang1]


Version 2.0.22
--------------

Released on July 15, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the
    `getNodeInfo()` function and the `Context.lookupNodeInfo()` method, where
    the NodeInfo document URL advertised in a remote server's
    `/.well-known/nodeinfo` response was fetched without checking that it
    points to a public address.  A malicious server could direct the link to
    a loopback, link-local, or private address—or to a `data:` URL—causing
    Fedify to fetch internal resources and return their contents to the
    caller.  Both requests, including any redirect hops, are now validated
    against private and non-public addresses, consistent with the protections
    already applied to WebFinger lookups and the built-in document loader.
    [[CVE-2026-62857]]

 -  Fixed custom collection dispatchers registered through
    `FederationBuilder.setCollectionDispatcher()` and
    `setOrderedCollectionDispatcher()` returning `404 Not Found` after
    `build()`.  `build()` now copies the collection callbacks and item types
    onto the built federation, so the registered routes dispatch their
    collections instead of being treated as unknown routes.
    [[#849], [#851] by ChanHaeng Lee]

 -  Fixed split-origin WebFinger responses for `acct:` aliases on the web
    origin host.  When a local actor is queried through the server-origin
    `acct:` alias, Fedify now returns the canonical handle-host `acct:` URI as
    the JRD `subject` and keeps the queried `acct:` URI in `aliases`.
    [[#920], [#921]]

### @fedify/vocab

 -  Fixed Activity Vocabulary parsing so malformed language tags in remote
    JSON-LD language maps no longer abort parsing with a `RangeError`.  Fedify
    now ignores only the malformed language-tagged value and continues parsing
    the rest of the object.  [[#847], [#848]]

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify nodeinfo` choosing SVG favicons whose filenames use
    uppercase `.SVG` extensions or include query strings or fragments.  The
    command now ignores those SVG favicon links and falls back to
    `/favicon.ico` before rendering terminal art.
    [[#891], [#918] by Junghoon Ban]


Version 2.0.21
--------------

Released on June 27, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed outbound activity delivery aborting when Linked Data Signatures
    creation fails during JSON-LD canonicalization.  Fedify now logs the
    signing failure and continues delivery without the Linked Data Signature
    for JSON-LD processing failures, while still surfacing key, configuration,
    and programming errors from signing.  [[#824], [#842] by Lee ByeongJun]

 -  Fixed inbox verification crashing when a remote actor document contains a
    malformed `publicKey` entry.  Fedify now treats the malformed key as a
    failed key lookup so HTTP Signatures verification fails normally instead of
    returning a server error.  [[#825], [#844] by Lee ByeongJun]


Version 2.0.20
--------------

Released on June 5, 2026.

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify` command failing under Deno 2.8+/TypeScript 6.0 where
    `setTimeout()` returns `Timeout` instead of `number`.  Used
    `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>` for the `signalTimers` WeakMap so it
    is compatible across all TypeScript/Deno versions.  [[#789] by Rui Chen]


Version 2.0.19
--------------

Released on June 4, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing special-use IPv4 ranges, such as
    shared address space, benchmarking, multicast, reserved, and documentation
    ranges, which could bypass private network protections in remote document
    loading.  [[CVE-2026-50131]]

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing IPv6 translation and tunneling
    prefixes, including NAT64, Teredo, and 6to4 addresses, which could bypass
    private network protections in remote document loading.  [[CVE-2026-50131]]


Version 2.0.18
--------------

Released on May 21, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a security vulnerability in Linked Data Signature verification that
    could allow certain signed activities to be interpreted differently than
    intended.  [[CVE-2026-42462]]


Version 2.0.17
--------------

Released on May 15, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `doubleKnock()` so transient transport failures such as DNS hiccups
    no longer leak raw `TypeError`s.  Idempotent authenticated document
    fetches are retried once, and remaining transport failures are reported as
    `FetchError` with the original error as the cause.  [[#762], [#763]]

 -  Fixed a `TypeError` thrown when Activity Vocabulary constructors received
    a `Temporal.Instant` or `Temporal.Duration` produced by an implementation
    other than the bundled `@js-temporal/polyfill` (for example, the native
    `Temporal` shipped with Node.js 26+).  Internal `instanceof` checks have
    been replaced with `Symbol.toStringTag`-based guards so any spec-conformant
    Temporal value is accepted.  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer
    import from `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal`
    namespace through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, which removes the
    nominal mismatch with native Temporal types.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is
    required to consume the type declarations.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added `isTemporalInstant()` and `isTemporalDuration()` type guards that
    accept both polyfill and native `Temporal` values via `Symbol.toStringTag`.
    [[#767], [#768]]

 -  Added the `@fedify/vocab-runtime/temporal` subpath export so consumers
    can import the new `Temporal` type guards without pulling in the rest of
    the runtime.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/postgres

 -  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer import from
    `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal` namespace
    through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, so `pollInterval` and
    `handlerTimeout` accept native `Temporal.Duration` values from Node.js
    26+ without a nominal type mismatch.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is
    required to consume the type declarations.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/redis

 -  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer import from
    `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal` namespace
    through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, so `pollInterval` accepts
    native `Temporal.Duration` values from Node.js 26+ without a nominal type
    mismatch.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is required to consume the type
    declarations.  [[#767], [#768]]

### @fedify/sqlite

 -  Generated _\*.d.ts_ declarations no longer import from
    `@js-temporal/polyfill`; they reference the ambient `Temporal` namespace
    through the `esnext.temporal` lib instead, so `pollInterval` accepts
    native `Temporal.Duration` values from Node.js 26+ without a nominal type
    mismatch.  TypeScript 6.0 or later is required to consume the type
    declarations.  [[#767], [#768]]


Version 2.0.16
--------------

Released on May 10, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing private IPv4 addresses encoded as
    IPv4-mapped IPv6 URL literals, such as `http://[::ffff:7f00:1]/`, which
    could bypass private network protections in remote document loading.


Version 2.0.15
--------------

Released on April 27, 2026.

### @fedify/init

 -  Fixed the Nitro and Next.js project templates so their generated
    *logging.ts* files are loaded during server startup.  Nitro projects now
    get a server plugin that imports the LogTape configuration, and Next.js
    projects get an *instrumentation.ts* `register()` hook that imports it in
    the Node.js runtime before Fedify handles requests.  [[#725], [#727]]


Version 2.0.14
--------------

Released on April 23, 2026.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added <https://join-lemmy.org/context.json> to preloaded JSON-LD contexts.
    Lemmy serves this context as `application/json` without a JSON-LD context
    `Link` header, which caused the default document loader to reject
    Lemmy-originated activities before application handlers could run.  [[#714]]


Version 2.0.13
--------------

Released on April 22, 2026.

### @fedify/next

 -  Widened `@fedify/next`'s supported Next.js peer dependency range to
    `>=15.4.6 <17`, so installing it into a fresh `create-next-app` 16.x
    project no longer fails with an `ERESOLVE` peer dependency conflict.
    This restores the default `fedify init -w next` flow against the current
    Next.js stable release and updates the integration example to track
    Next.js 16.  [[#713]]


Version 2.0.12
--------------

Released on April 8, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `Context.getActorKeyPairs()` assigning the same key ID to both
    the `CryptographicKey` (used for HTTP Signatures and Linked Data
    Signatures) and the `Multikey` (used for Object Integrity Proofs) within
    an `ActorKeyPair`.  The `Multikey` now receives a distinct ID
    (`#multikey-1`, `#multikey-2`, …) so that the actor document no longer
    contains two objects sharing the same `id`, which was invalid JSON-LD.
    Object Integrity Proof signatures now reference the correct `Multikey` ID
    instead of the `CryptographicKey` ID.  [[#663]]

 -  Object Integrity Proofs signing now takes place before activity fanout,
    so all recipients receive the same pre-signed activity.  Previously, OIP
    signing was deferred until after fanout, meaning each fanout worker would
    re-sign independently with potentially different timestamps and the fanout
    message itself contained an unsigned activity.

### @fedify/cfworkers

 -  Fixed a remaining TypeScript type mismatch for Cloudflare Workers users who
    pass `wrangler types` or `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` generated KV bindings to
    `WorkersKvStore`.  The package now accepts a minimal structural KV binding
    interface for `WorkersKvStore` and `WorkersMessageQueue`'s `orderingKv`
    option instead of requiring the nominal `KVNamespace` type imported from
    `@cloudflare/workers-types`, so generated local declarations compile
    without casts or `@ts-expect-error`.  [[#665]]


Version 2.0.11
--------------

Released on April 7, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `sendActivity()` not awaiting `fanoutQueue.enqueue()` in the fanout
    path, which could cause fanout messages to be silently dropped on runtimes
    like Cloudflare Workers that may terminate an isolate as soon as the
    response is sent.  [[#661]]

### @fedify/cfworkers

 -  Fixed a TypeScript type mismatch that occurred when passing
    `wrangler types`-generated binding types (e.g. `KVNamespace`, `Queue`)
    to `WorkersKvStore` and `WorkersMessageQueue` constructors.  The package
    previously imported these types from
    `@cloudflare/workers-types/experimental`, which includes extra members
    (such as `KVNamespace.deleteBulk()`) absent from types generated by
    `wrangler types`, causing TypeScript assignment errors at the call site.
    The import now uses the stable `@cloudflare/workers-types` entrypoint,
    whose definitions match what `wrangler types` generates.  [[#662]]


Version 2.0.10
--------------

Released on March 31, 2026.

### @fedify/lint

 -  Fixed the published ESM output paths for `@fedify/lint` so the package
    exports and type declarations point to the actual files generated by
    `tsdown`.  This restores imports such as
    `import fedifyLint from "@fedify/lint"` in documentation examples and other
    TypeScript consumers.

### @fedify/init

 -  Restored the npm entrypoint contract for `@fedify/init` after the `tsdown`
    upgrade started publishing `dist/*.mjs` files while the package metadata
    still exported `dist/*.js` and `dist/*.d.ts`.  Node.js consumers such as
    `@fedify/cli` can start again, including `npx -y @fedify/cli --help`.
    [[#655]]

### @fedify/create

 -  Restored the npm CLI entrypoint for `@fedify/create` so the published
    `bin` and `exports` paths once again point to generated `dist/mod.js`
    output instead of missing `dist/mod.js` files.  This prevents the same
    packaging regression from breaking `npm init @fedify`.  [[#655]]


Version 2.0.9
-------------

Released on March 29, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed CommonJS builds of `@fedify/fedify/vocab` missing the `Object`
    export from the entry point.  Older `tsdown` output generated an invalid
    CommonJS re-export, causing `require("@fedify/fedify/vocab").Object` to be
    `undefined`.  Updated the bundler toolchain and added a regression test for
    the built CommonJs entry point.  [[#651]]


Version 2.0.8
-------------

Released on March 27, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Limited the number of HTTP redirects followed by the remote document
    loaders and signed HTTP fetches to mitigate resource exhaustion during
    remote key and document resolution.  [[CVE-2026-34148] by Abhinav Jaswal]

 -  Stopped the remote document loaders and signed HTTP fetches from
    revisiting the same URL within a redirect chain, preventing
    self-referential redirect loops.  [[CVE-2026-34148] by Abhinav Jaswal]

 -  Persisted negative public key cache entries for failed remote key
    fetches, reducing repeated retries against the same unavailable key
    across requests.  [[CVE-2026-34148] by Abhinav Jaswal]


Version 2.0.7
-------------

Released on March 22, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Switched Fedify's source-based JSON-LD loading to the new
    `@fedify/vocab-runtime/jsonld` subpath so generated vocabulary code and
    Linked Data signature support no longer have to evaluate `jsonld` through
    a CommonJS-sensitive package root in Fresh 2, Deno, and other ESM-first
    runtimes.  Fresh 2 development mode has been verified on Deno 2.7.7
    after an upstream Deno 2.7.6 dev server regression was fixed.
    [[#621], [#639]]

[#621]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/621
[#639]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/639

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Fixed multibase public key handling to stop relying on the deprecated
    CommonJS-only `multicodec` package.  This removes the Vite SSR crash that
    prevented Fresh 2 applications from importing `@fedify/fedify` with
    `TypeError: varint.encode is not a function`.  Fresh 2 no longer needs a
    Vite externalization workaround for Fedify.  [[#621], [#639]]

 -  Added the new `@fedify/vocab-runtime/jsonld` subpath export so generated
    vocabulary code and other Fedify runtime code can share a JSR-safe wrapper
    around `jsonld`'s ESM entrypoint instead of depending on fragile relative
    shims or the package-root import path.  [[#621], [#639]]

### @fedify/init

 -  Revived removed `fedify init` options.  [[#632], [#638] by ChanHaeng Lee]
     -  `bare-bones` option for web framework.
     -  `in-memory` option for key-value store.
     -  `in-process` option for message queue.

[#638]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/638


Version 2.0.6
-------------

Released on March 19, 2026.

### @fedify/init

 -  Fixed `fedify init` crashing when `@fedify/cli` or `@fedify/init` is
    executed through the JSR/Deno distribution.  `import.meta.dirname` is
    `undefined` for remote JSR modules, so the template loading and
    repository-relative path logic has been made safe for published JSR
    execution.  [[#624], [#633]]

[#624]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/624
[#633]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/633

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Added <http://joinmastodon.org/ns> to preloaded JSON-LD contexts.
    This URL has never served a real JSON-LD context document (Mastodon
    has always inlined the term definitions), but some ActivityPub
    implementations put it as a bare URL in their `@context`, causing
    JSON-LD processors to fail with a 404.  [[#630], [#631]]

[#630]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/630
[#631]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/631


Version 2.0.5
-------------

Released on March 11, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Added <https://w3id.org/security/data-integrity/v2> to preloaded JSON-LD
    contexts.


Version 2.0.4
-------------

Released on March 11, 2026.

### @fedify/fastify

 -  Fixed the default `onNotAcceptable` handler in `@fedify/fastify` to
    create a fresh `Response` for each request instead of reusing a shared
    singleton instance.  [[#612] by Lee Dogeon]

[#612]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/612


Version 2.0.3
-------------

Released on March 3, 2026.

### @fedify/postgres

 -  Fixed `PostgresMessageQueue.listen()` crashing the process when a
    malformed `NOTIFY` payload is received.  `Temporal.Duration.from()`
    was called without error handling, so an invalid duration string
    caused an unhandled `RangeError` that propagated through the postgres
    driver.  The `NOTIFY` callback is now wrapped in a `try`–`catch` that
    logs the error and falls back to an immediate poll.  [[#594]]

 -  Fixed `PostgresMessageQueue.listen()` permanently stalling all message
    processing when a message handler hangs indefinitely (e.g., due to an
    unresponsive remote server).  The `serializedPoll` mechanism chains
    every `poll()` invocation onto a single promise, so a single hung
    handler blocked the entire queue permanently.  Handler invocations
    are now wrapped with a configurable timeout (default: 60 seconds)
    via the new `handlerTimeout` option in `PostgresMessageQueueOptions`.
    When a handler exceeds the timeout, it is treated as an error and the
    poll loop moves on, preventing permanent stalls.  [[#595]]

[#595]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/595


Version 2.0.2
-------------

Released on February 27, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Removed the deprecated third and fourth parameters (`signedKey` and
    `signedKeyOwner`) from `AuthorizePredicate` and
    `ObjectAuthorizePredicate`.  These parameters were deprecated since
    Fedify 1.5.0 in favor of `RequestContext.getSignedKey()` and
    `RequestContext.getSignedKeyOwner()` methods, but were mistakenly
    left in the Fedify 2.0.0 release.  The internal handler code that
    eagerly called `getSignedKey()` and `getSignedKeyOwner()` before
    invoking the predicate has also been removed; predicates should now
    call those methods themselves when needed.  [[#473], [#590]]

[#590]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/590


Version 2.0.1
-------------

Released on February 24, 2026.

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify` command hanging indefinitely when invoked as an executable
    (e.g., via `npx @fedify/cli` or `npm exec -- fedify`) on Linux.  The
    shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env node --disable-warning=ExperimentalWarning`
    was passing `node --disable-warning=ExperimentalWarning` as a single
    argument to `env`, which caused an infinite exec loop on Linux because the
    kernel passes all shebang arguments as one string.  Fixed by using
    `env -S` to properly split arguments:
    `#!/usr/bin/env -S node --disable-warning=ExperimentalWarning`.

### @fedify/postgres

 -  Fixed `PostgresMessageQueue.listen()` permanently stopping message
    processing when `poll()` throws (e.g., transient PostgreSQL errors or
    handler failures).  `listen()` now catches polling errors for subscribe,
    notify, and interval-triggered polls, logs them, and retries on subsequent
    triggers instead of terminating the listener.  [[#581]]

 -  `PostgresMessageQueue.initialize()` now creates an index on the `created`
    column (`idx_{table}_created`) to improve dequeue query performance under
    backlog growth.  [[#581]]

[#581]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/581


Version 2.0.0
-------------

Released on February 22, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Remove `contextLoader` option (which was deprecated) from
    `FederationOptions` interface in favor of `contextLoaderFactory` option
    for better flexibility.  [[#376], [#445] by Hasang Cho]

 -  Migrated from *@phensley/language-tag* package and its `LanguageTag` class
    to the standardized `Intl.Locale` class for representing language tags.
    [[#280], [#392] by Jang Hanarae]

     -  The `LanguageString.language` property is now `LanguageString.locale`
        and is of type `Intl.Locale` instead of `LanguageTag`.
     -  The `LanguageString` constructor now accepts either an `Intl.Locale`
        object or a string for the language parameter.
     -  The `Link.language` property is now of type `Intl.Locale` instead
        of `LanguageTag`.
     -  Removed the `@phensley/language-tag` dependency.

 -  Remove `documentLoader` option (which was deprecated) from
    `FederationOptions` interface in favor of `documentLoaderFactory` option
    for better flexibility.  [[#376], [#393] by Hasang Cho]

 -  Remove `CreateFederationOptions<TContextData>` interface (which was
    deprecated since 1.6.0).  Use `FederationOptions<TContextData>` instead.
    [[#376]]

 -  Remove `fetchDocumentLoader()` function (which was deprecated since 0.14.0).
    Use `getDocumentLoader()` from `@fedify/vocab-runtime` instead.  [[#376]]

 -  Remove `{ handle: string }` parameter form from `sendActivity()`,
    `forwardActivity()`, `getDocumentLoader()`, and `ParseUriResult`.
    Use `{ identifier: string }` or `{ username: string }` instead.  [[#376]]

 -  Changed NodeInfo `software.version` field type from `SemVer` to `string`
    to properly handle non-SemVer version strings in accordance with the
    NodeInfo specification.  [[#366], [#433] by Hyeonseo Kim]

     -  The `parseNodeInfo()` function now returns version as `string` instead
        of `SemVer` object.
     -  The `Software.version` field is now of `string` (was of `SemVer`).
     -  Removed `parseSemVer()` and `formatSemVer()` functions.
     -  Updated related CLI tools and documentation.

 -  Federation dispatchers are now only triggered when the request accepts
    ActivityPub-compatible content types.  This improves compatibility with
    applications that serve both HTML and ActivityPub content from the same
    URLs.  [[#434] by Emelia Smith]

     -  Actor, object, and collection dispatchers will no longer be called for
        requests with `Accept: text/html` or other non-ActivityPub content
        types.
     -  The `notAcceptable` callback is now triggered at the middleware level
        before dispatchers are invoked.
     -  If your application relies on dispatchers being called regardless of
        `Accept` header, you may need to adjust your routing logic.

 -  Changed the default activity idempotency strategy from `"per-origin"` to
    `"per-inbox"` to align with standard ActivityPub behavior.  [[#441]]

     -  Activities are now deduplicated per inbox by default, allowing the same
        activity ID to be processed once per inbox independently.
     -  The previous `"per-origin"` strategy (deduplicate per receiving server)
        can still be explicitly configured using
        `.withIdempotency("per-origin")`.
     -  This change ensures proper delivery of activities to multiple inboxes
        on the same server, fixing issues where activities were incorrectly
        deduplicated globally.

 -  Separated modules from `@fedify/fedify/runtime` to improve modularity and
    reduce coupling between vocabulary generation and core federation
    functionality.  [[#444], [#451] by ChanHaeng Lee]

     -  Modules related to ActivityPub vocabulary generation have been extracted
        into the new `@fedify/vocab-runtime` package.
     -  Other utility modules from `@fedify/fedify/runtime` have been
        reorganized into the `@fedify/fedify/utils` directory within the main
        package.
     -  Updated import paths throughout the codebase to reflect the new module
        organization.

 -  Deprecated the `@fedify/fedify/runtime` module in favor of the new
    `@fedify/vocab-runtime` package.  The `@fedify/fedify/runtime` module now
    re-exports all exports from `@fedify/vocab-runtime` for backward
    compatibility, but will be removed in a future version.  Please migrate
    to `@fedify/vocab-runtime` directly.  [[#560]]

 -  The `KvCacheParameters.rules` option's type became
    `[string | URL | URLPattern, Temporal.Duration | Temporal.DurationLike][]`
    (was `[string | URL | URLPattern, Temporal.Duration][]`).

 -  The `@fedify/fedify/x/*` modules are removed.  Also, there are no Fresh
    integration for now. [[#391] by Chanhaeng Lee]

     -  Removed `@fedify/fedify/x/cfworkers` in favor of `@fedify/cfworkers`.
     -  Removed `@fedify/fedify/x/denokv` in favor of `@fedify/denokv`.
     -  Removed `@fedify/fedify/x/hono` in favor of `@fedify/hono`.
     -  Removed `@fedify/fedify/x/sveltekit` in favor of `@fedify/sveltekit`.
     -  Removed `@fedify/fedify/x/fresh` (Fresh integration). [[#466]]

 -  Deprecated the `@fedify/fedify/vocab` module in favor of the new
    `@fedify/vocab` package.  The `@fedify/fedify/vocab` module now re-exports
    all exports from `@fedify/vocab` for backward compatibility, but will be
    removed in a future version.  Please migrate to `@fedify/vocab` directly.
    [[#437], [#517] by ChanHaeng Lee]

 -  The `KvStore.list()` method is now required instead of optional.
    This method was added as optional in version 1.10.0 to give existing
    implementations time to add support.  All official `KvStore` implementations
    already support this method.  [[#499], [#506]]

 -  Added `orderingKey` option to `MessageQueueEnqueueOptions` interface for
    ordered message delivery.  Messages with the same ordering key are
    guaranteed to be processed in the order they were enqueued, while messages
    with different ordering keys can be processed in parallel.  This helps
    prevent race conditions when processing related activities (e.g., ensuring
    a `Delete` activity is processed after a `Create` activity for the same
    object).  [[#536], [#538], [#540], [#544]]

     -  Added `MessageQueueEnqueueOptions.orderingKey` property.
     -  All properties in `MessageQueueEnqueueOptions` are now `readonly`.
     -  `InProcessMessageQueue` now supports the `orderingKey` option.
     -  Added `SendActivityOptions.orderingKey` option to ensure ordered
        delivery of activities for the same object.  When specified, activities
        with the same `orderingKey` are guaranteed to be delivered in order
        to each recipient server.

 -  Added `Federatable.setOutboxPermanentFailureHandler()` method to handle
    permanent delivery failures (such as `410 Gone` or `404 Not Found`) when
    sending activities to remote inboxes.  This allows applications to clean
    up unreachable followers and avoid future delivery attempts to permanently
    failed inboxes.  [[#548], [#559]]

 -  Added `permanentFailureStatusCodes` option to `FederationOptions` to
    configure which HTTP status codes are treated as permanent delivery
    failures.  By default, `404` and `410` are treated as permanent failures.
    [[#548], [#559]]

 -  Added `SendActivityError` class, a structured error that is thrown when
    an activity fails to send to a remote inbox.  It includes the HTTP status
    code, the inbox URL, and the response body, making it easier to
    programmatically handle delivery errors.  [[#548], [#559]]

 -  Added `traceId` and `spanId` to LogTape context in federation middleware
    so that log records emitted during request handling and queue processing
    include the OpenTelemetry trace and span IDs in their properties.  This
    enables the `@fedify/debugger` dashboard to display per-trace logs.
    [[#561], [#564]]

 -  Fixed unbounded memory consumption when activity delivery fails with large
    error responses.  The `SendActivityError.responseBody` property is now
    limited to 1 KiB to prevent memory pressure when remote servers return
    large HTML error pages (e.g., Cloudflare error pages of 50–100 KB each).
    This prevents potential OOM crashes in production environments with many
    unreachable inboxes.  [[#569]]

### @fedify/cli

 -  The Fedify CLI now runs natively on Node.js and Bun without requiring
    compiled binaries, providing a more natural JavaScript package experience
    for Node.js and Bun users.  [[#374], [#456], [#457]]

 -  Added `fedify generate-vocab` command to generate Activity Vocabulary
    classes from schema files.  This command uses the new *@fedify/vocab-tools*
    package internally and allows users to extend Activity Vocabulary with
    custom types.  [[#444], [#458] by ChanHaeng Lee]

 -  Updated `fedify init` command for better DX.
    [[#397], [#435] by Chanhaeng Lee]

     -  If the directory is not empty, prompts the user for confirmation
        before proceeding. If the user agrees, it moves the remaining directory
        to trash and continue the initialization from new created directory.
     -  Ask again if some options is not specified or invalid.

 -  The `fedify lookup` command now supports multiple URLs with the
    `-t`/`--traverse` option, allowing users to traverse multiple collections
    in a single command.  [[#408], [#449] by Jiwon Kwon]

 -  The `fedify init` command now supports [Elysia] as a web framework option,
    with runtime-specific templates for Deno, Bun, and Node.js environments.
    [[#460], [#496] by Hyeonseo Kim]

 -  Fixed a bug in the `fedify init` command where Deno import map generation
    incorrectly handled dependencies with registry prefixes (e.g., `npm:`),
    creating invalid specifiers in *deno.json*.
    [[#460], [#496] by Hyeonseo Kim]

 -  Added `fedify relay` command to run an ephemeral ActivityPub relay server.
    [[#510], [#518] by Jiwon Kwon]

     -  Supports both Mastodon and LitePub relay protocols via `--protocol`
        option.
     -  Provides optional persistent storage via `--persistent` option with
        SQLite database.
     -  Allows configuring subscription approval/rejection via `--accept-follow`
        and `--reject-follow` options.
     -  Tunnels the relay server to the public internet by default for external
        access, with `--no-tunnel` option to run locally only.

 -  Added `--tunnel-service` option to `fedify lookup`, `fedify inbox`, and
    `fedify relay` commands to select the tunneling service (localhost.run,
    serveo.net, or pinggy.io).  Also added `--tunnel-service` as an alias
    to the existing `-s`/`--service` option in `fedify tunnel` for consistency.
    [[#525], [#529], [#531] by Jiwon Kwon]

 -  Added configuration file support for CLI commands.  The CLI now loads
    settings from configuration files at multiple levels, with a well-defined
    precedence chain.  [[#555], [#566] by Jiwon Kwon]

     -  By default, configuration is loaded (in order of increasing precedence)
        from a system-wide configuration file (*/etc/xdg/fedify/config.toml*),
        a user-level configuration file (*~/.config/fedify/config.toml*),
        and *.fedify.toml* in the current directory; later files override
        earlier ones.
     -  Added `--config` option to specify a custom configuration file path;
        this file has the highest precedence over all other configuration
        sources.
     -  Added `--ignore-config` option to skip configuration file loading.
     -  All command options (`inbox`, `lookup`, `webfinger`, `nodeinfo`,
        `tunnel`, `relay`) can now be configured via any of the configuration
        files.

### @fedify/debugger

 -  Created the *@fedify/debugger* package, an embedded real-time ActivityPub
    debug dashboard for Fedify.  It wraps an existing `Federation` object as
    a proxy, intercepting requests to a configurable path prefix (default
    `/__debug__`) and serving an SSR-based web UI.  [[#561], [#564]]

     -  Added `createFederationDebugger()` function that returns a
        `Federation` proxy with a built-in debug dashboard.  When called
        without an `exporter` option, it automatically sets up OpenTelemetry
        tracing (creating `MemoryKvStore`, `FedifySpanExporter`,
        `BasicTracerProvider`) and registers it as the global tracer
        provider—no manual OTel configuration needed.
     -  Traces list page showing trace IDs, activity types, activity counts,
        and timestamps, with auto-polling for real-time updates.
     -  Trace detail page showing activity direction, type, actor, signature
        verification details, inbox URL, and expandable activity JSON.
     -  JSON API endpoint at `/__debug__/api/traces` for programmatic access.
     -  Added per-trace log collection using LogTape.  The returned federation
        object now includes a `sink` property (a LogTape `Sink` function)
        that captures log records grouped by trace ID.  In the simplified
        overload (without `exporter`), LogTape is auto-configured.
     -  Trace detail page now shows a “Logs” section with log level, timestamp,
        logger category, and message for each log record in the trace.
     -  JSON API endpoint at `/__debug__/api/logs/:traceId` for retrieving
        log records for a specific trace.
     -  Added optional `auth` configuration for protecting the debug dashboard
        with authentication.  Supports three modes: password-only,
        username + password, and request-based (e.g., IP filtering).
        Each mode supports both static credentials and callback functions.
        Uses cookie-based sessions with HMAC-signed tokens.

### @fedify/relay

 -  Created ActivityPub relay integration as the *@fedify/relay* package.
    [[#359], [#459], [#471], [#490], [#510], [#518] by Jiwon Kwon]

     -  Added `Relay` interface defining the common contract for relay
        implementations.
     -  Added `MastodonRelay` class implementing Mastodon-compatible relay
        protocol.
     -  Added `LitePubRelay` class implementing LitePub-compatible relay
        protocol.
     -  Added `SubscriptionRequestHandler` type for custom subscription approval
        logic.
     -  Added `RelayOptions` interface for relay configuration.
     -  Added `RelayType` type alias to document the type-safe parameter
     -  Added `createRelay()` factory function as a key public API

### @fedify/vocab-tools

 -  Created Activity Vocabulary code generator as the *@fedify/vocab-tools*
    package.  Separated vocabulary code generation tools from the main
    *@fedify/fedify* package to improve modularity and enable custom vocabulary
    extensions across different JavaScript runtimes.
    [[#444], [#458] by ChanHaeng Lee]

     -  Made the code generator runtime-agnostic, supporting Deno, Node.js,
        and Bun environments.
     -  Provides programmatic API for generating vocabulary classes from
        schema files.
     -  Integrated with `fedify generate-vocab` CLI command.
     -  Published to both npm and JSR for broad ecosystem compatibility.

### @fedify/vocab-runtime

 -  Created ActivityPub vocabulary runtime as the *@fedify/vocab-runtime*
    package.  Separated core vocabulary generation and processing modules
    from the main *@fedify/fedify* package to improve modularity and reduce
    coupling between vocabulary processing and federation functionality.
    [[#444], [#451] by ChanHaeng Lee]

     -  Extracted `DocumentLoader`, `RemoteDocument`, and related types from
        the main package.
     -  Moved cryptographic key processing utilities, e.g., `importSpki`,
        `exportSpki`, `importMultibaseKey`, `exportMultibaseKey`.
     -  Relocated multibase encoding/decoding functionality.
     -  Separated language string processing (`LanguageString` class).
     -  This package is primarily used by generated vocabulary classes and
        provides the runtime infrastructure for ActivityPub object processing.

### @fedify/elysia

 -  Added *deno.json* configuration file to enable proper Deno tooling support
    in the package.  [[#460], [#496]]

### @fedify/lint

 -  Created Fedify linting tools as the *@fedify/lint* package.
    This package provides shared Deno Lint and ESLint configurations for
    consistent code style across Fedify packages and user projects.
    [[#297], [#494] by ChanHaeng Lee]

[#297]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/297
[#494]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/494

### @fedify/fresh

 -  Created a new @fedify/fresh package that provides seamless integration
    between Fedify and Fresh 2.0, replacing the deprecated
    `@fedify/fedify/x/fresh` module that was designed for Fresh 1.x.
    [[#466], [#478] by Hyeonseo Kim]

[#478]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/478

### @fedify/webfinger

 -  Created WebFinger utilities as the *@fedify/webfinger* package.
    This package provides tools for working with WebFinger resources,
    including parsing and generating WebFinger documents.
    [[#517] by ChanHaeng Lee]

### @fedify/vocab

 -  Created ActivityPub Vocabulary API package as the *@fedify/vocab* package.
    This package contains the generated Activity Vocabulary classes and
    related types, separated from the main *@fedify/fedify* package to
    improve modularity and enable custom vocabulary extensions.
    The previous `@fedify/fedify/vocab` module is now deprecated and
    re-exports all exports from this package for backward compatibility.
    [[#437], [#517] by ChanHaeng Lee]

 -  `@fedify/vocab` now re-exports `LanguageString`, `DocumentLoader`,
    `GetUserAgentOptions`, and `RemoteDocument` from `@fedify/vocab-runtime`
    so that downstream consumers do not need to depend on
    `@fedify/vocab-runtime` directly.  [[#560]]

 -  Fixed `@fedify/vocab-runtime` being bundled inline into `@fedify/vocab`'s
    ESM/CJS output instead of being kept as an external dependency.  This
    caused `instanceof LanguageString` checks to fail because two distinct
    `LanguageString` classes existed at runtime.  [[#560]]

### @fedify/sqlite

 -  Added `SqliteMessageQueue` class implementing `MessageQueue` interface
    using SQLite as the backing store.  This implementation uses polling to
    check for new messages and is suitable for single-node deployments and
    development environments.  [[#477], [#526] by ChanHaeng Lee]

     -  Added `SqliteMessageQueue` class.
     -  Added `SqliteMessageQueueOptions` interface.

 -  `SqliteMessageQueue` now supports the `orderingKey` option to ensure
    messages with the same ordering key are processed sequentially.
    [[#538], [#540]]

     -  Added `ordering_key` column to the message queue table schema.
     -  The new table schema is created when `SqliteMessageQueue.initialize()`
        is called on a fresh database.

[#477]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/477
[#526]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/526

### @fedify/testing

 -  Added `testMessageQueue()` utility function for standardized testing of
    `MessageQueue` implementations.  This function provides a reusable test
    harness that covers common message queue operations including `enqueue()`,
    `enqueue()` with delay, `enqueueMany()`, and multiple listener scenarios.
    [[#477], [#526] by ChanHaeng Lee]

     -  Added `testMessageQueue()` function.
     -  Added `waitFor()` helper function.
     -  Added `getRandomKey()` helper function.

 -  Added `TestMessageQueueOptions` interface and optional `options` parameter
    to `testMessageQueue()` function.  [[#538], [#540]]

     -  Added `TestMessageQueueOptions` interface.
     -  Added `testOrderingKey` option to enable ordering key tests.

### @fedify/redis

 -  Fixed a race condition in `RedisMessageQueue.listen()` where pub/sub
    notifications could be missed if `enqueue()` was called immediately after
    `listen()` started.  The issue occurred because the message handler was
    attached inside an async callback, allowing a timing window where messages
    could be published before the handler was ready.
    [[#515], [#532] by Jiwon Kwon]

 -  `RedisMessageQueue` now supports the `orderingKey` option to ensure
    messages with the same ordering key are processed sequentially.
    [[#538], [#540]]

[#515]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/515
[#532]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/532

### @fedify/postgres

 -  `PostgresMessageQueue` now supports the `orderingKey` option to ensure
    messages with the same ordering key are processed sequentially.
    [[#538], [#540]]

     -  Added `ordering_key` column to the message queue table schema.
     -  The new table schema is created when `PostgresMessageQueue.initialize()`
        is called on a fresh database.

 -  Fixed a race condition in `PostgresMessageQueue.initialize()` where
    concurrent calls from `listen()` and `enqueue()` would run DDL
    statements in parallel, causing redundant table creation and
    `ALTER TABLE` operations.  The initialization promise is now cached
    so that concurrent callers share the same work.

 -  Fixed `PostgresMessageQueue.listen()` spawning many concurrent
    `poll()` calls when a burst of `NOTIFY` signals arrived (e.g., from
    bulk enqueue of 100 messages), causing excessive database contention.
    Poll executions are now serialized so that at most one runs at a time,
    with subsequent requests queued after the current one finishes.

### @fedify/amqp

 -  `AmqpMessageQueue` now supports the `orderingKey` option to ensure
    messages with the same ordering key are processed sequentially.
    [[#538], [#540]]

     -  Uses RabbitMQ's `rabbitmq_consistent_hash_exchange` plugin to route
        messages with the same ordering key to the same queue.
     -  The plugin must be enabled on the RabbitMQ server for ordering key
        support to work.

### @fedify/cfworkers

 -  `WorkersMessageQueue` now supports the `orderingKey` option to ensure
    messages with the same ordering key are processed sequentially.
    [[#538], [#540]]

     -  Added `WorkersMessageQueueOptions` interface with `orderingKv`,
        `orderingKeyPrefix`, and `orderingLockTtl` options.
     -  Added `processMessage()` method to handle lock acquisition and release.
     -  Requires a Workers KV namespace for lock management.
     -  Due to Workers KV eventual consistency, ordering is best-effort.

### @fedify/init

 -  Created project initializer as the *@fedify/init* package.  Separated
    the `fedify init` functionality from *@fedify/cli* into a standalone
    package to improve modularity and enable reuse by other tools such as
    `@fedify/create`.  [[#482] by Chanhaeng Lee]

     -  Added `runInit()` function as the main initialization action handler.
     -  Added `initCommand` and `initOptions` for CLI integration.
     -  Added `testInitCommand` for comprehensive testing of all init
        combinations.

[#482]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/482

### @fedify/create

 -  Created standalone project scaffolding CLI as the *@fedify/create*
    package.  This enables creating new Fedify projects without installing
    the full `@fedify/cli` toolchain.  [[#351] by Chanhaeng Lee]

     -  Supports `npm init @fedify`, `pnpm create @fedify`,
        `yarn create @fedify`, and `bunx @fedify/create`.
     -  Uses `@fedify/init` internally for all initialization logic.
     -  Supports the same interactive prompts and CLI options as
        `fedify init`.

[#351]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/351


Version 1.10.12
---------------

Released on July 15, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the
    `getNodeInfo()` function and the `Context.lookupNodeInfo()` method, where
    the NodeInfo document URL advertised in a remote server's
    `/.well-known/nodeinfo` response was fetched without checking that it
    points to a public address.  A malicious server could direct the link to
    a loopback, link-local, or private address—or to a `data:` URL—causing
    Fedify to fetch internal resources and return their contents to the
    caller.  Both requests, including any redirect hops, are now validated
    against private and non-public addresses, consistent with the protections
    already applied to WebFinger lookups and the built-in document loader.
    [[CVE-2026-62857]]


Version 1.10.11
---------------

Released on June 4, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing special-use IPv4 ranges, such as
    shared address space, benchmarking, multicast, reserved, and documentation
    ranges, which could bypass private network protections in remote document
    loading.  [[CVE-2026-50131]]

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing IPv6 translation and tunneling
    prefixes, including NAT64, Teredo, and 6to4 addresses, which could bypass
    private network protections in remote document loading.  [[CVE-2026-50131]]


Version 1.10.10
---------------

Released on May 21, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a security vulnerability in Linked Data Signature verification that
    could allow certain signed activities to be interpreted differently than
    intended.  [[CVE-2026-42462]]


Version 1.10.9
--------------

Released on May 10, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing private IPv4 addresses encoded as
    IPv4-mapped IPv6 URL literals, such as `http://[::ffff:7f00:1]/`, which
    could bypass private network protections in remote document loading.


Version 1.10.8
--------------

Released on April 8, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `Context.getActorKeyPairs()` assigning the same key ID to both
    the `CryptographicKey` (used for HTTP Signatures and Linked Data
    Signatures) and the `Multikey` (used for Object Integrity Proofs) within
    an `ActorKeyPair`.  The `Multikey` now receives a distinct ID
    (`#multikey-1`, `#multikey-2`, …) so that the actor document no longer
    contains two objects sharing the same `id`, which was invalid JSON-LD.
    Object Integrity Proof signatures now reference the correct `Multikey` ID
    instead of the `CryptographicKey` ID.  [[#663]]

 -  Object Integrity Proofs signing now takes place before activity fanout,
    so all recipients receive the same pre-signed activity.  Previously, OIP
    signing was deferred until after fanout, meaning each fanout worker would
    re-sign independently with potentially different timestamps and the fanout
    message itself contained an unsigned activity.


Version 1.10.7
--------------

Released on April 7, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `sendActivity()` not awaiting `fanoutQueue.enqueue()` in the fanout
    path, which could cause fanout messages to be silently dropped on runtimes
    like Cloudflare Workers that may terminate an isolate as soon as the
    response is sent.  [[#661]]


Version 1.10.6
--------------

Released on March 29, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed CommonJS builds of `@fedify/fedify/vocab` missing the `Object`
    export from the entry point.  Older `tsdown` output generated an invalid
    CommonJS re-export, causing `require("@fedify/fedify/vocab").Object` to be
    `undefined`.  Updated the bundler toolchain and added a regression test for
    the built CommonJs entry point.  [[#651]]


Version 1.10.5
--------------

Released on March 27, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Limited the number of HTTP redirects followed by the remote document
    loaders and signed HTTP fetches to mitigate resource exhaustion during
    remote key and document resolution.  [[CVE-2026-34148] by Abhinav Jaswal]

 -  Stopped the remote document loaders and signed HTTP fetches from
    revisiting the same URL within a redirect chain, preventing
    self-referential redirect loops.  [[CVE-2026-34148] by Abhinav Jaswal]

 -  Persisted negative public key cache entries for failed remote key
    fetches, reducing repeated retries against the same unavailable key
    across requests.  [[CVE-2026-34148] by Abhinav Jaswal]


Version 1.10.4
--------------

Released on March 11, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Added <https://w3id.org/security/data-integrity/v2> to preloaded JSON-LD
    contexts.


Version 1.10.3
--------------

Released on February 1, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `traverseCollection()` yielding no items when a `Collection` has
    an inline `CollectionPage` in its `first` property without an explicit
    `id`.  This is common in Mastodon's `replies` collections.  The function
    previously used `collection.firstId` to determine pagination, which
    returned `null` for inline pages without an `id`, causing it to
    incorrectly fall into the non-paginated branch.  [[#550] by Lee Dogeon]

[#550]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/550


Version 1.10.2
--------------

Released on January 23, 2026.

### @fedify/testing

 -  Fixed `TestContext.getActorKeyPairs()` returning empty array instead of
    calling registered key pairs dispatcher.  The method now properly invokes
    the key pairs dispatcher when it is registered via
    `setKeyPairsDispatcher()`. [[#530]]

[#530]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/530


Version 1.10.1
--------------

Released on January 22, 2026.

### @fedify/testing

 -  Fixed `TestContext.getActor()` and `TestContext.getObject()` returning
    `null` instead of calling registered dispatchers.  The methods now properly
    invoke actor and object dispatchers when they are registered via
    `setActorDispatcher()` and `setObjectDispatcher()`.  [[#530]]


Version 1.10.0
--------------

Released on December 24, 2025.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Enhanced OpenTelemetry instrumentation with span events for capturing
    detailed activity data.  Span events now record complete activity JSON
    payloads and verification status, enabling richer observability and
    debugging capabilities without relying solely on span attributes
    (which only support primitive values).  [[#323]]

     -  Added `activitypub.activity.received` span event to the
        `activitypub.inbox` span, recording the full activity JSON,
        verification status (activity verified, HTTP signatures verified,
        Linked Data signatures verified), and actor information.
     -  Added `activitypub.activity.sent` span event to the
        `activitypub.send_activity` span, recording the full activity JSON
        and target inbox URL.
     -  Added `activitypub.object.fetched` span event to the
        `activitypub.lookup_object` span, recording the fetched object's
        type and complete JSON-LD representation.

 -  Added OpenTelemetry spans for previously uninstrumented operations:
    [[#323]]

     -  Added `activitypub.fetch_document` span for document loader operations,
        tracking URL fetching, HTTP redirects, and final document URLs.
     -  Added `activitypub.verify_key_ownership` span for cryptographic
        key ownership verification, recording actor ID, key ID, verification
        result, and the verification method used.

 -  Added optional `list()` method to the `KvStore` interface for enumerating
    entries by key prefix.  This method takes an optional `prefix` parameter;
    when omitted or empty, it returns all entries.  This enables efficient
    prefix scanning which is useful for implementing features like distributed
    trace storage, cache invalidation by prefix, and listing related entries.
    [[#498], [#500]]

     -  Added `KvStoreListEntry` interface.
     -  Implemented in `MemoryKvStore`.

 -  Added `FedifySpanExporter` class that persists ActivityPub activity traces
    to a `KvStore` for distributed tracing support.  This enables aggregating
    trace data across multiple nodes in a distributed deployment, making it
    possible to build debug dashboards that show complete request flows across
    web servers and background workers.  [[#497], [#502]]

     -  Added `@fedify/fedify/otel` module.
     -  Added `FedifySpanExporter` class implementing OpenTelemetry's
        `SpanExporter` interface.
     -  Added `TraceActivityRecord` interface for stored activity data,
        including `actorId` and `signatureDetails` fields for debug dashboard
        support.
     -  Added `SignatureVerificationDetails` interface for detailed signature
        verification information.
     -  Added `TraceSummary` interface for trace listing.
     -  Added `FedifySpanExporterOptions` interface.
     -  Added `GetRecentTracesOptions` interface.
     -  Added `ActivityDirection` type.

Version 1.9.13
--------------

Released on July 15, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the
    `getNodeInfo()` function and the `Context.lookupNodeInfo()` method, where
    the NodeInfo document URL advertised in a remote server's
    `/.well-known/nodeinfo` response was fetched without checking that it
    points to a public address.  A malicious server could direct the link to
    a loopback, link-local, or private address—or to a `data:` URL—causing
    Fedify to fetch internal resources and return their contents to the
    caller.  Both requests, including any redirect hops, are now validated
    against private and non-public addresses, consistent with the protections
    already applied to WebFinger lookups and the built-in document loader.
    [[CVE-2026-62857]]


Version 1.9.12
--------------

Released on June 4, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing special-use IPv4 ranges, such as
    shared address space, benchmarking, multicast, reserved, and documentation
    ranges, which could bypass private network protections in remote document
    loading.  [[CVE-2026-50131]]

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing IPv6 translation and tunneling
    prefixes, including NAT64, Teredo, and 6to4 addresses, which could bypass
    private network protections in remote document loading.  [[CVE-2026-50131]]


Version 1.9.11
--------------

Released on May 21, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a security vulnerability in Linked Data Signature verification that
    could allow certain signed activities to be interpreted differently than
    intended.  [[CVE-2026-42462]]


Version 1.9.10
--------------

Released on May 10, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `validatePublicUrl()` allowing private IPv4 addresses encoded as
    IPv4-mapped IPv6 URL literals, such as `http://[::ffff:7f00:1]/`, which
    could bypass private network protections in remote document loading.


Version 1.9.9
-------------

Released on April 8, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `Context.getActorKeyPairs()` assigning the same key ID to both
    the `CryptographicKey` (used for HTTP Signatures and Linked Data
    Signatures) and the `Multikey` (used for Object Integrity Proofs) within
    an `ActorKeyPair`.  The `Multikey` now receives a distinct ID
    (`#multikey-1`, `#multikey-2`, …) so that the actor document no longer
    contains two objects sharing the same `id`, which was invalid JSON-LD.
    Object Integrity Proof signatures now reference the correct `Multikey` ID
    instead of the `CryptographicKey` ID.  [[#663]]

 -  Object Integrity Proofs signing now takes place before activity fanout,
    so all recipients receive the same pre-signed activity.  Previously, OIP
    signing was deferred until after fanout, meaning each fanout worker would
    re-sign independently with potentially different timestamps and the fanout
    message itself contained an unsigned activity.


Version 1.9.8
-------------

Released on April 7, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `sendActivity()` not awaiting `fanoutQueue.enqueue()` in the fanout
    path, which could cause fanout messages to be silently dropped on runtimes
    like Cloudflare Workers that may terminate an isolate as soon as the
    response is sent.  [[#661]]


Version 1.9.7
-------------

Released on March 29, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed CommonJS builds of `@fedify/fedify/vocab` missing the `Object`
    export from the entry point.  Older `tsdown` output generated an invalid
    CommonJS re-export, causing `require("@fedify/fedify/vocab").Object` to be
    `undefined`.  Updated the bundler toolchain and added a regression test for
    the built CommonJs entry point.  [[#651]]


Version 1.9.6
-------------

Released on March 27, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Limited the number of HTTP redirects followed by the remote document
    loaders and signed HTTP fetches to mitigate resource exhaustion during
    remote key and document resolution.  [[CVE-2026-34148] by Abhinav Jaswal]

 -  Stopped the remote document loaders and signed HTTP fetches from
    revisiting the same URL within a redirect chain, preventing
    self-referential redirect loops.  [[CVE-2026-34148] by Abhinav Jaswal]

 -  Persisted negative public key cache entries for failed remote key
    fetches, reducing repeated retries against the same unavailable key
    across requests.  [[CVE-2026-34148] by Abhinav Jaswal]


Version 1.9.5
-------------

Released on February 1, 2026.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed `traverseCollection()` yielding no items when a `Collection` has
    an inline `CollectionPage` in its `first` property without an explicit
    `id`.  This is common in Mastodon's `replies` collections.  The function
    previously used `collection.firstId` to determine pagination, which
    returned `null` for inline pages without an `id`, causing it to
    incorrectly fall into the non-paginated branch.  [[#550] by Lee Dogeon]


Version 1.9.4
-------------

Released on January 23, 2026.

### @fedify/testing

 -  Fixed `TestContext.getActorKeyPairs()` returning empty array instead of
    calling registered key pairs dispatcher.  The method now properly invokes
    the key pairs dispatcher when it is registered via
    `setKeyPairsDispatcher()`. [[#530]]


Version 1.9.3
-------------

Released on January 22, 2026.

### @fedify/testing

 -  Fixed `TestContext.getActor()` and `TestContext.getObject()` returning
    `null` instead of calling registered dispatchers.  The methods now properly
    invoke actor and object dispatchers when they are registered via
    `setActorDispatcher()` and `setObjectDispatcher()`.  [[#530]]


Version 1.9.2
-------------

Released on December 20, 2025.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability in
    the document loader's HTML parsing.  An attacker-controlled server could
    respond with a malicious HTML payload that blocked the event loop.
    [[CVE-2025-68475]]

[CVE-2025-68475]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/security/advisories/GHSA-rchf-xwx2-hm93

### @fedify/sqlite

 -  Fixed `SyntaxError: Identifier 'Temporal' has already been declared` error
    that occurred when using `SqliteKvStore` on Node.js or Bun.  The error
    was caused by duplicate `Temporal` imports during the build process.
    [[#487]]

[#487]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/487


Version 1.9.1
-------------

Released on October 31, 2025.

### @fedify/testing

 -  Fixed JSR publishing hanging indefinitely at the *processing* stage by
    hiding complex type exports from the public API.  The JSR type analyzer
    struggled with complex type dependencies when analyzing the
    `MockFederation`, `TestFederation`, `TestContext`, and `SentActivity`
    types, causing indefinite hangs during the processing stage.  [[#468]]

     -  *Breaking change*: `MockFederation` class is no longer exported from
        the public API.  Use `createFederation()` factory function instead.
     -  `TestFederation<TContextData>`, `TestContext<TContextData>`, and
        `SentActivity` interfaces are no longer exported from the public API,
        but their types are still inferred from `createFederation()` return type
        and can be used via TypeScript's type inference.

[#468]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/468

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify` command failing on Windows with `PermissionDenied` error
    when trying to locate or execute package managers during initialization.
    The CLI now properly handles _\*.cmd_ and _\*.bat_ files on Windows by
    invoking them through `cmd /c`.  [[#463]]

[#463]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/463


Version 1.9.0
-------------

Released on October 14, 2025.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Implemented [FEP-fe34] origin-based security model to protect against
    content spoofing attacks and ensure secure federation practices.  The
    security model enforces same-origin policy for ActivityPub objects and
    their properties, preventing malicious actors from impersonating content
    from other servers.  [[#440]]

     -  Added `crossOrigin` option to Activity Vocabulary property accessors
        (`get*()` methods) with three security levels: `"ignore"` (default,
        logs warning and returns `null`), `"throw"` (throws error), and
        `"trust"` (bypasses checks).
     -  Added `LookupObjectOptions.crossOrigin` option to `lookupObject()`
        function and `Context.lookupObject()` method for controlling
        cross-origin validation.
     -  Embedded objects are now validated against their parent object's origin
        and only trusted when they share the same origin or are explicitly
        marked as trusted.
     -  Property hydration now respects origin-based security, automatically
        performing remote fetches when embedded objects have different origins.
     -  Internal trust tracking system maintains security context throughout
        object lifecycles (construction, cloning, and property access).

 -  Added `withIdempotency()` method to configure activity idempotency
    strategies for inbox processing.  This addresses issue [#441] where
    activities with the same ID sent to different inboxes were incorrectly
    deduplicated globally instead of per-inbox.  [[#441]]

     -  Added `IdempotencyStrategy` type.
     -  Added `IdempotencyKeyCallback` type.
     -  Added `InboxListenerSetters.withIdempotency()` method.
     -  By default, `"per-origin"` strategy is used for backward compatibility.
        This will change to `"per-inbox"` in Fedify 2.0.  We recommend
        explicitly setting the strategy to avoid unexpected behavior changes.

 -  Fixed handling of ActivityPub objects containing relative URLs.  The
    Activity Vocabulary classes now automatically resolve relative URLs by
    inferring the base URL from the object's `@id` or document URL, eliminating
    the need for manual `baseUrl` specification in most cases.  This improves
    interoperability with ActivityPub servers that emit relative URLs in
    properties like `icon.url` and `image.url`.  [[#411], [#443] by Jiwon Kwon]

 -  Added TypeScript support for all [RFC 6570] URI Template expression types
    in dispatcher path parameters.  Previously, only simple string expansion
    (`{identifier}`) was supported in TypeScript types, while the runtime
    already supported all RFC 6570 expressions.  Now TypeScript accepts all
    expression types including `{+identifier}` (reserved string expansion,
    recommended for URI identifiers), `{#identifier}` (fragment expansion),
    `{.identifier}` (label expansion), `{/identifier}` (path segments),
    `{;identifier}` (path-style parameters), `{?identifier}` (query component),
    and `{&identifier}` (query continuation).  [[#426], [#446] by Jiwon Kwon]

     -  Added `Rfc6570Expression<TParam>` type helper.
     -  Updated all dispatcher path type parameters to accept RFC 6570
        expressions: `setActorDispatcher()`, `setObjectDispatcher()`,
        `setInboxDispatcher()`, `setOutboxDispatcher()`,
        `setFollowingDispatcher()`, `setFollowersDispatcher()`,
        `setLikedDispatcher()`, `setFeaturedDispatcher()`,
        `setFeaturedTagsDispatcher()`, `setInboxListeners()`,
        `setCollectionDispatcher()`, and `setOrderedCollectionDispatcher()`.

 -  Added inverse properties for collections to Vocabulary API.
    [[FEP-5711], [#373], [#381] by Jiwon Kwon]

     -  `new Collection()` constructor now accepts `likesOf` option.
     -  Added `Collection.likesOfId` property.
     -  Added `Collection.getLikesOf()` method.
     -  `new Collection()` constructor now accepts `sharesOf` option.

     -  Added `Collection.outboxOfId` property.
     -  Added `Collection.getOutboxOf()` method.
     -  `new Collection()` constructor now accepts `followersOf` option.
     -  Added `Collection.followersOfId` property.
     -  Added `Collection.getFollowersOf()` method.
     -  `new Collection()` constructor now accepts `followingOf` option.
     -  Added `Collection.followingOfId` property.
     -  Added `Collection.getFollowingOf()` method.
     -  `new Collection()` constructor now accepts `likedOf` option.
     -  Added `Collection.likedOfId` property.
     -  Added `Collection.getLikedOf()` method.

 -  Changed how `parseSoftware()` function handles non-Semantic Versioning
    number strings on `tryBestEffort` mode.  [[#353], [#365] by Hyeonseo Kim]

 -  Separated modules from `@fedify/fedify/x` into dedicated packages to
    improve modularity and reduce bundle size.  The existing integration
    functions in `@fedify/fedify/x` are now deprecated and will be removed in
    version 2.0.0.  [[#375] by Chanhaeng Lee]

     -  Deprecated `@fedify/fedify/x/cfworkers` in favor of `@fedify/cfworkers`.
     -  Deprecated `@fedify/fedify/x/denokv` in favor of `@fedify/denokv`.
     -  Deprecated `@fedify/fedify/x/hono` in favor of `@fedify/hono`.
     -  Deprecated `@fedify/fedify/x/sveltekit` in favor of `@fedify/sveltekit`.

 -  Extended `Link` from `@fedify/fedify/webfinger` to support
    [OStatus 1.0 Draft 2].  [[#402], [#404] by Hyeonseo Kim]

     -  Added an optional `template` field to the `Link` interface.
     -  Changed the `href` field optional from the `Link` interface according to
        [RFC 7033 Section 4.4.4.3].

 -  Added `Federatable.setWebFingerLinksDispatcher()` method to set additional
    links to WebFinger.  [[#119], [#407] by Hyeonseo Kim]

 -  Added CommonJS support alongside ESM for better NestJS integration and
    broader Node.js ecosystem compatibility.  This eliminates the need for
    Node.js's `--experimental-require-module` flag and resolves dual package
    hazard issues.  [[#429], [#431]]

### @fedify/cli

 -  Added `Next.js` option to `fedify init` command. This option allows users
    to initialize a new Fedify project with Next.js integration.
    [[#313] by Chanhaeng Lee]

 -  Changed how `fedify nodeinfo` command handles non-Semantic Versioning
    number strings on `-b`/`--best-effort` mode.  Now it uses the same logic as
    the `parseSoftware()` function in the *@fedify/fedify* package, which
    allows it to parse non-Semantic Versioning number strings more flexibly.
    [[#353], [#365] by Hyeonseo Kim]]

 -  Added `-T`/`--timeout` option to `fedify lookup` command. This option allows
    users to specify timeout in seconds for network requests to prevent
    hanging on slow or unresponsive servers.

 -  Fixed a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability in
    the document loader's HTML parsing.  An attacker-controlled server could
    respond with a malicious HTML payload that blocked the event loop.
    [[CVE-2025-68475]]

### @fedify/sqlite

 -  Fixed `SyntaxError: Identifier 'Temporal' has already been declared` error
    that occurred when using `SqliteKvStore` on Node.js or Bun.  The error
    was caused by duplicate `Temporal` imports during the build process.
    [[#487]]


Version 1.8.14
--------------

Released on October 19, 2025.

### @fedify/testing

 -  Fixed JSR publishing hanging indefinitely at the *processing* stage.
    The issue was caused by TypeScript function overload signatures in
    `MockContext` and `MockFederation` classes that triggered a bug in JSR's
    type analyzer.  All method overloads have been removed and simplified to
    use `any` types where necessary.  [[#468], [#470]]

[#470]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/470

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify` command failing on Windows with `PermissionDenied` error
    when trying to locate or execute package managers during initialization.
    The CLI now properly handles _\*.cmd_ and _\*.bat_ files on Windows by

Version 1.8.13
--------------

Released on October 10, 2025.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed inconsistent encoding/decoding of URI template identifiers with
    special characters.  Updated *uri-template-router* to version 1.0.0,
    which properly decodes percent-encoded characters in URI template variables
    according to RFC 6570.  This resolves issues where identifiers containing
    URIs (e.g., `https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com`) were being inconsistently decoded
    in dispatcher callbacks and double-encoded in collection URLs.  [[#416]]

Version 1.8.12
--------------

Released on September 20, 2025.

### @fedify/sqlite

 -  Fixed bundling issues where incorrect import paths to *node\_modules* were
    included in the bundled output.  The *@js-temporal/polyfill* dependency
    was moved from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` to ensure proper
    bundling.


Version 1.8.11
--------------

Released on September 17, 2025.

 -  Improved the AT Protocol URI workaround to handle all DID methods and
    edge cases. The fix now properly percent-encodes any authority component
    in `at://` URIs, supporting `did:web`, `did:key`, and other DID methods
    beyond just `did:plc`. Also handles URIs without path components
    correctly.  [[#436]]

[#436]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/436


Version 1.8.10
--------------

Released on September 17, 2025.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Added a temporary workaround for invalid AT Protocol URIs from BridgyFed.
    URIs like `at://did:plc:...` that violate RFC 3986 URI syntax are now
    automatically URL-encoded to `at://did%3Aplc%3A...` to prevent parsing
    failures when processing bridged Bluesky content.  [[#436]]


Version 1.8.9
-------------

Released on September 10, 2025.

 -  Integration and database adapter packages (*@fedify/amqp*, *@fedify/elysia*,
    *@fedify/express*, *@fedify/h3*, *@fedify/nestjs*, *@fedify/postgres*,
    *@fedify/redis*, *@fedify/sqlite*, *@fedify/testing*) now specify explicit
    version ranges for the *@fedify/fedify* peer dependency instead of
    accepting any version, improving compatibility guarantees.


Version 1.8.8
-------------

Released on August 25, 2025.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a bug where `verifyRequest()` function threw a `TypeError` when
    verifying HTTP Signatures with `created` or `expires` fields in
    the `Signature` header as defined in draft-cavage-http-signatures-12,
    causing `500 Internal Server Error` responses in inbox handlers.
    Now it correctly handles these fields as unquoted integers according
    to the specification.


Version 1.8.7
-------------

Released on August 25, 2025.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a bug where ActivityPub Discovery failed to recognize XHTML
    self-closing `<link>` tags. The HTML/XHTML parser now correctly handles
    whitespace before the self-closing slash (`/>`), improving compatibility
    with XHTML documents that follow the self-closing tag format.


Version 1.8.6
-------------

Released on August 24, 2025.

### @fedify/nestjs

 -  Fixed a critical error that prevented the middleware from processing
    ActivityPub requests in NestJS applications. The middleware now correctly
    handles request bodies that have been pre-processed by other NestJS
    middleware or interceptors.  [[#279], [#386] by Jaeyeol Lee]

[#279]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/279
[#386]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/386

### @fedify/testing

 -  Updated exports to include context creation functions.
    [[#382] by Colin Mitchell]

     -  Added `createContext()` function.
     -  Added `createInboxContext()` function.
     -  Added `createRequestContext()` function.

[#382]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/382


Version 1.8.5
-------------

Released on August 8, 2025.

### @fedify/fedify

 -  Fixed a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the inbox handler
    that allowed unauthenticated attackers to impersonate any ActivityPub actor.
    The vulnerability occurred because activities were processed before
    verifying that the HTTP Signatures key belonged to the claimed actor.
    Now authentication verification is performed before activity processing to
    prevent actor impersonation attacks.  [[CVE-2025-54888]]

[CVE-2025-54888]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/security/advisories/GHSA-6jcc-xgcr-q3h4

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify nodeinfo` color support in Windows Terminal.
    [[#358], [#360] by KeunHyeong Park]

[#358]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/358
[#360]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/360


Version 1.8.4
-------------

Released on August 7, 2025.

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `fedify lookup` command's `-r`/`--raw`, `-C`/`--compact`, and
    `-e`/`--expand` options to properly output valid JSON format instead of
    Deno's object inspection format.  [[#357]]

[#357]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/357


Version 1.8.3
-------------

Released on August 6, 2025.

### @fedify/cli

 -  Restored image resizing functionality in `fedify lookup` command by using
    the existing [Jimp] library for image manipulation. This properly displays
    `icon` and `image` fields with appropriate sizing in terminals.

 -  Added support for Ghostty terminal emulator for image rendering in
    `fedify lookup` command.

[Jimp]: https://jimp-dev.github.io/jimp/


Version 1.8.2
-------------

Released on August 6, 2025.

### @fedify/cli

 -  Fixed `npx @fedify/cli` command not working on various platforms by
    correcting the binary path resolution in the Node.js wrapper script.

 -  Temporarily removed Sharp dependency to resolve installation issues
    across different platforms. As a result, `fedify lookup` command will no
    longer resize images when displaying them in the terminal. This is a
    temporary workaround and image resizing functionality will be restored
    in a future patch version using an alternative approach.

 -  Fixed build artifact paths in GitHub Actions workflow to correctly
    reference CLI package location in the monorepo structure.


Version 1.8.1
-------------

Released on August 6, 2025.  Note that 1.8.0 was skipped due to a mistake in
the versioning.

 -  The repository has been restructured as a monorepo, consolidating all
    Fedify packages into a single repository with unified versioning.  This
    change affects the following packages:

     -  *@fedify/fedify* (main library)
     -  *@fedify/cli* (CLI toolchain)
     -  *@fedify/amqp* (AMQP/RabbitMQ driver)
     -  *@fedify/express* (Express integration)
     -  *@fedify/h3* (h3 framework integration)
     -  *@fedify/postgres* (PostgreSQL drivers)
     -  *@fedify/redis* (Redis drivers)

    All packages now follow the same version number and are released together.
    Previously, each package had independent versioning.

 -  Several new packages have been added to the monorepo:

     -  *@fedify/elysia* ([Elysia] integration)
     -  *@fedify/nestjs* ([NestJS] integration)
     -  *@fedify/sqlite* (SQLite drivers)
     -  *@fedify/testing* (testing utilities)

[NestJS]: https://nestjs.com/

    This functions simplify working with fediverse handles and URLs.
    [[#278] by ChanHaeng Lee]

     -  `FediverseHandle`: An interface representing a fediverse handle.
     -  `parseFediverseHandle()`: A function to parse a fediverse handle into
        its components.
     -  `isFediverseHandle()`: A function to check if a string is a valid
        fediverse handle.
     -  `toAcctUrl()`: A function to convert a fediverse handle to a `URL`.

 -  Added `LookupWebFingerOptions.maxRedirection` option.
    [[#248], [#281] by Lee ByeongJun]

### @fedify/cli

 -  The `fedify` CLI now correctly disables color output when standard output
    isn't a TTY (for example, when redirecting to a file) or when the `NO_COLOR`
    environment variable is set.  [[#257], [#341] by Cho Hasang]

 -  Added `fedify nodeinfo` command, and deprecated `fedify node` command in
    favor of `fedify nodeinfo`.  [[#267], [#331] by Hyeonseo Kim]

 -  Added `fedify webfinger` command. This command allows users to look up
    WebFinger information for a given resource.
    [[#260], [#278] by ChanHaeng Lee]

     -  The input can be a handle (e.g., `@user@server`, `user@server`) or
        a URL (e.g., `https://server/users/path`).
     -  The `--user-agent` or `-a` option used as `User-Agent` header value
        in the WebFinger request.
     -  The `--allow-private-address` or `-p` option allows looking up
        WebFinger information for private addresses (e.g., `localhost`).
     -  The `--max-redirection` option allows uses to specify the maximum
        number of redirects to follow when performing WebFinger lookups.
        [[#311], [#328] by KeunHyeong Park]

 -  The `fedify lookup` command now displays images depending on user's
    terminal emulator. [[#169], [#348] by Jiwon Kwon]

     -  Supported terminal emulators are [Kitty], [WezTerm], [Konsole], [Warp],
        [Wayst], [st], and [iTerm].

 -  Added `-o`/`--output` option to `fedify lookup` command. This option allows
    users to save retrieved lookup results to specified path.
    [[#261], [#321] by Jiwon Kwon]

 -  Added options to customize the temporary actor information when running
    `fedify inbox` command.  [[#262], [#285] by Hasang Cho]

     -  Added `--actor-name` option to customize the actor display name.
     -  Added `--actor-summary` option to customize the actor description.
     -  Both options provide sensible defaults when not specified.

 -  The `fedify inbox` command now displays the type of the object contained
    in each activity, in addition to the activity's own type.
    [[#191], [#342] by Jang Hanarae]

 -  Added `--dry-run` option to `fedify init` command.  This option allows users
    to preview what files and configurations would be created without actually
    creating them.  [[#263], [#298] by Lee ByeongJun]

 -  Fixed a bug where the `fedify nodeinfo` command (was `fedify node`) had
    failed to correctly render the favicon in terminal emulators that do not
    support 24-bit colors.  [[#168], [#282], [#304] by Hyeonseo Kim]

### @fedify/testing

 -  Added mock classes for `Federation` and `Context` interfaces to improve
    testability without requiring a real federation server setup. The mock
    classes track all sent activities with metadata and support all standard
    Fedify patterns including custom path registration and multiple activity
    type listeners.  [[#197], [#283] by Lee ByeongJun]

     -  Added *@fedify/testing* package.
     -  Added `MockFederation` class.
     -  Added `MockContext` class.

[#283]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/283


Version 1.7.16
--------------

Released on December 20, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where the npm package failed to load at runtime with an error
    like
    `SyntaxError: The requested module '../types.js' does not provide an export named 'i'`.
    This was a regression introduced in version 1.7.15.


Version 1.7.15
--------------

Released on December 20, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where TypeScript declaration files (*.d.ts*) were not included
    in the npm package, causing type errors when importing the package.


Version 1.7.14
--------------

Released on December 20, 2025.

 -  Fixed a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability in
    the document loader's HTML parsing.  An attacker-controlled server could
    respond with a malicious HTML payload that blocked the event loop.
    [[CVE-2025-68475]]

    verifying HTTP Signatures with `created` or `expires` fields in
    the `Signature` header as defined in draft-cavage-http-signatures-12,
    causing `500 Internal Server Error` responses in inbox handlers.
    Now it correctly handles these fields as unquoted integers according

    whitespace before the self-closing slash (`/>`), improving compatibility
    with XHTML documents that follow the self-closing tag format.


Version 1.7.9
-------------

Released on August 8, 2025.

 -  Fixed a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the inbox handler
    that allowed unauthenticated attackers to impersonate any ActivityPub actor.
    The vulnerability occurred because activities were processed before
    verifying that the HTTP Signatures key belonged to the claimed actor.
    Now authentication verification is performed before activity processing to
    prevent actor impersonation attacks.  [[CVE-2025-54888]]


Version 1.7.8
-------------

Released on August 5, 2025.

 -  Updated `kvCache()` wrapper to read from preloaded contexts rather than
    from the `KvStore`. This saves network and disk overheads when parsing
    activities and objects using the JSON-LD processor.
    [[#352] by Fabien O'Carroll]

[#352]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/352


Version 1.7.7
-------------

Released on July 28, 2025.

 -  Optimized `doubleKnock()` function to avoid multiple request body clones
    during redirects.  The request body is now read once and reused throughout
    the entire operation, preventing potential `TypeError: unusable` errors
    and improving performance.  [[#300], [#335] by Fabien O'Carroll]

     -  Added `SignRequestOptions.body` option.
     -  Added `DoubleKnockOptions.body` option.
     -  Updated internal signing functions to accept pre-read body buffers.

[#300]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/300
[#335]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/335


Version 1.7.6
-------------

Released on July 24, 2025.

 -  Fixed `doubleKnock()` to properly handle redirects with path-only `Location`
    headers by resolving them relative to the original request URL.
    [[#324] by Fabien O'Carroll]

[#324]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/324


Version 1.7.5
-------------

Released on July 15, 2025.

 -  Fixed `TypeError: unusable` error that occurred when `doubleKnock()`
    encountered redirects during HTTP signature retry attempts.

[#295]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/295


Version 1.7.4
-------------

Released on July 13, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug the `-T`/`--no-tunnel` option in the `fedify inbox` command
    was being ignored, causing the server to always create a public tunnel
    regardless of the flag. [[#243], [#284] by Lee ByeongJun]

[#243]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/243
[#284]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/284


Version 1.7.3
-------------

Released on July 9, 2025.

 -  Added `"default"` export conditions to all package exports in
    *package.json* for improved Node.js compatibility.


Version 1.7.2
-------------

Released on July 2, 2025.

 -  Fixed HTTP signature verification to handle malformed RFC 9421 signatures
    gracefully instead of returning `500 Internal Server Error` responses.
    Malformed signatures now properly fail verification and return appropriate
    error responses.


Version 1.7.1
-------------

Released on June 30, 2025.

 -  Fixed JSON-LD serialization of the `Question.voters` property to correctly
    serialize as a plain number (e.g., `"votersCount": 123`) instead of as a
    typed literal object (e.g.,
    `"votersCount":{"type":"xsd:nonNegativeInteger", "@value":123}`).


Version 1.7.0
-------------

Released on June 25, 2025.

 -  Added optional `MessageQueue.nativeRetrial` property to indicate whether
    the message queue backend provides native retry mechanisms.  When `true`,
    Fedify will skip its own retry logic and rely on the backend to handle
    retries.  When `false` or omitted, Fedify will handle retries using its
    own retry policies.  [[#250], [#251]]

     -  `DenoKvMessageQueue.nativeRetrial` is `true`.
     -  `WorkersMessageQueue.nativeRetrial` is `true`.
     -  `InProcessMessageQueue.nativeRetrial` is `false`.
     -  `ParallelMessageQueue.nativeRetrial` inherits from the wrapped queue.

 -  Added `FederationOptions.firstKnock` option to configure the HTTP
    Signatures specification used for the first signature attempt when
    communicating with unknown servers.  This implements the [double-knocking]
    mechanism for better compatibility across different ActivityPub servers.
    Defaults to `"rfc9421"` (RFC 9421: HTTP Message Signatures), with fallback
    to `"draft-cavage-http-signatures-12"` if the first attempt fails.

    URIs like `at://did:plc:...` that violate RFC 3986 URI syntax are now
    automatically URL-encoded to `at://did%3Aplc%3A...` to prevent parsing
    failures when processing bridged Bluesky content.  [[#436]]


Version 1.6.10
--------------

Released on August 25, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where `verifyRequest()` function threw a `TypeError` when
    verifying HTTP Signatures with `created` or `expires` fields in
    the `Signature` header as defined in draft-cavage-http-signatures-12,
    causing `500 Internal Server Error` responses in inbox handlers.
    Now it correctly handles these fields as unquoted integers according
    to the specification.


Version 1.6.9
-------------

Released on August 25, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where ActivityPub Discovery failed to recognize XHTML
    self-closing `<link>` tags. The HTML/XHTML parser now correctly handles
    whitespace before the self-closing slash (`/>`), improving compatibility
    with XHTML documents that follow the self-closing tag format.


Version 1.6.8
-------------

Released on August 8, 2025.

 -  Fixed a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the inbox handler
    that allowed unauthenticated attackers to impersonate any ActivityPub actor.
    The vulnerability occurred because activities were processed before
    verifying that the HTTP Signatures key belonged to the claimed actor.
    Now authentication verification is performed before activity processing to
    prevent actor impersonation attacks.  [[CVE-2025-54888]]


Version 1.6.7
-------------

Released on July 24, 2025.

 -  Fixed `doubleKnock()` to properly handle redirects with path-only `Location`
    headers by resolving them relative to the original request URL.
    [[#324] by Fabien O'Carroll]


Version 1.6.6
-------------

Released on July 15, 2025.

 -  Fixed `TypeError: unusable` error that occurred when `doubleKnock()`
    encountered redirects during HTTP signature retry attempts.
    [[#294], [#295]]


Version 1.6.5
-------------

Released on July 9, 2025.

 -  Added `"default"` export conditions to all package exports in
    *package.json* for improved Node.js compatibility.


Version 1.6.4
-------------

Released on July 2, 2025.

 -  Fixed HTTP signature verification to handle malformed RFC 9421 signatures
    gracefully instead of returning `500 Internal Server Error` responses.
    Malformed signatures now properly fail verification and return appropriate
    error responses.


Version 1.6.3
-------------

Released on June 30, 2025.

 -  Fixed JSON-LD serialization of the `Question.voters` property to correctly
    serialize as a plain number (e.g., `"votersCount": 123`) instead of as a
    typed literal object (e.g.,
    `"votersCount":{"type":"xsd:nonNegativeInteger", "@value":123}`).


Version 1.6.2
-------------

Released on June 19, 2025.

 -  Fixed compatibility issue with Mastodon servers running bleeding-edge
    versions with RFC 9421 implementation bugs. Extended double-knocking
    to retry with draft-cavage-http-signatures-12 on `5xx` errors as a temporary
    workaround for Mastodon's RFC 9421 implementation that returns
    `500 Internal Server Error`.

-------------

Released on June 7, 2025.  Note that 1.6.0 was skipped due to a mistake in
the versioning.

 -  Added `Context.lookupWebFinger()` method to make WebFinger lookups

Version 1.5.9
-------------

Released on September 17, 2025.

 -  Improved the AT Protocol URI workaround to handle all DID methods and
    edge cases. The fix now properly percent-encodes any authority component
    in `at://` URIs, supporting `did:web`, `did:key`, and other DID methods
    beyond just `did:plc`. Also handles URIs without path components
    correctly.  [[#436]]


Version 1.5.8
-------------

Released on September 17, 2025.

Version 1.5.3
-------------

Released on May 16, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where inbox handler had thrown a `jsonld.SyntaxError` which
    caused a `500 Internal Server Error` when the received activity had
    an invalid JSON-LD syntax.  Now it logs the error and responds with
    a `400 Bad Request` error instead.  [[#232]]

 -  The `exportJwk()` function now populates the `alg` property of a returned
    `JsonWebKey` object with `"Ed25519"` if the input key is an Ed25519 key.

Version 1.5.1
-------------

Released on April 8, 2025.

 -  Activity Vocabulary API became to accept [RFC 3339] date-time strings
    without a timezone offset.  This is not a bug fix, but improves
    interoperability with some implementations that do not include a timezone
    offset in their date-time strings including WordPress.  [[#226]]

 -  Added the following default context to `Undo` class:

    ~~~~ json
    {
      "litepub": "http://litepub.social/ns#",
      "toot": "http://joinmastodon.org/ns#",
      "EmojiReact": "litepub:EmojiReact",
      "Emoji": "toot:Emoji"
    }
    ~~~~

Version 1.5.0
-------------

Released on March 28, 2025.

 -  Improved activity delivery performance with large audiences through
    a two-stage queuing system.  Sending activities to many recipients
    (e.g., accounts with many followers) is now significantly faster and uses
    less memory. [[#220]]

     -  Added `FederationQueueOptions.fanout` option.
     -  Changed the type of `FederationStartQueueOptions.queue` option to
        `"inbox" | "outbox" | "fanout" | undefined` (was
        `"inbox" | "outbox" | undefined`).
     -  Added `SendActivityOptions.fanout` option.
     -  Added OpenTelemetry instrumented span `activitypub.fanout`.
     -  The `ForwardActivityOptions` interface became a type alias of
        `Omit<SendActivityOptions, "fanout"> & { skipIfUnsigned: boolean }`,
        which is still compatible with the previous version.

 -  A `Federation` object now can have a canonical origin for web URLs and
    a canonical host for fediverse handles.  This affects the URLs constructed
    by `Context` objects, and the WebFinger responses.

     -  Added `CreateFederationOptions.origin` option.
     -  Added `FederationOrigin` interface.
     -  Added `Context.canonicalOrigin` property.

 -  Followers collection synchronization ([FEP-8fcf]) is now turned off by
    default.

     -  Added `SendActivityOptionsForCollection` interface.
     -  The type of
        `Context.sendActivity({ identifier: string } | { username: string } | { handle: string }, "followers", Activity)`
        overload's fourth parameter became
        `SendActivityOptionsForCollection | undefined` (was
        `SendActivityOptions | undefined`).

 -  Fedify now accepts PEM-PKCS#1 besides PEM-SPKI for RSA public keys.
    [[#209]]

     -  `CryptographicKey` now can contain a `publicKey` with a PEM-PKCS#1
        format (in addition to PEM-SPKI).
     -  Added `importPkcs1()` function.
     -  Added `importPem()` function.

 -  The `fetchKey()` function became to choose the public key of the actor
    if `keyId` has no fragment and the actor has only one public key.  [[#211]]

 -  Added an optional parameter with `GetSignedKeyOptions` type to
    the `RequestContext.getSignedKey()` method.

 -  Added `GetSignedKeyOptions` interface.

 -  Added an optional parameter with `GetKeyOwnerOptions` type to
    the `RequestContext.getSignedKeyOwner()` method.

 -  Deprecated the parameters of the `AuthorizePredicate` and
    `ObjectAuthorizePredicate` types to get the signed key and its owner
    in favor of the `RequestContext.getSignedKey()` and
    `RequestContext.getSignedKeyOwner()` methods.

     -  Deprecated the third parameter of the `AuthorizePredicate` type in favor
        of the `RequestContext.getSignedKey()` method.
     -  Deprecated the fourth parameter of the `AuthorizePredicate` type in
        favor of the `RequestContext.getSignedKeyOwner()` method.
     -  Deprecated the third parameter of the `ObjectAuthorizePredicate` type in
        favor of the `RequestContext.getSignedKey()` method.
     -  Deprecated the fourth parameter of the `ObjectAuthorizePredicate` type
        in favor of the `RequestContext.getSignedKeyOwner()` method.

 -  Added an optional method `enqueueMany()` to `MessageQueue` interface
    for sending multiple activities at once.

 -  Updated *@js-temporal/polyfill* to 0.5.0 for Node.js and Bun.  On Deno,
    there is no change because the polyfill is not used.

 -  Updated *uri-template-router* to 0.0.17 which fixes bundler errors on
    Rollup.  [[#221]]

 -  Improved error handling and logging for document loader when KV store
    operations fail.  [[#223] by Revath S Kumar]

 -  Fixed a bug of the `fedify inbox` command where it had failed to render
    the web interface when the `fedify` command was installed using
    `deno install` command from JSR.

 -  The web interface of the `fedify inbox` command was slightly redesigned:

     -  The Fedify logo with the cute dinosaur is now displayed at the top of
        the page.
     -  You can easily copy the fediverse handle of the ephemeral actor.

 -  Internalized the [multibase] package, which is obsolete and no longer
    maintained.  [[#127], [#215] by Fróði Karlsson]

 -  Added more log messages using the [LogTape] library.  Currently the below
    logger categories are used:

     -  `["fedify", "federation", "fanout"]`
     -  `["fedify", "federation", "object"]`

 -  Fixed a bug with nested object hydration in Activity Vocabulary API where
    deeply nested properties (like `Object.getAttribution()` on
    `Activity.getObject()`) were't being properly hydrated during `toJsonLd()`
    calls. Previously, subsequent calls to `toJsonLd()` on nested objects could
    result in inconsistent JSON-LD output where nested objects remained as URLs
    instead of being fully expanded.


Version 1.4.0
-------------

Released on February 5, 2025.

 -  Document loader and context loader are now configurable with a factory
    function for more flexibility.

        can be disabled by excluding `autoIdAssigner()` from
        the `CreateFederationOptions.activityTransformers` option.

 -  Introduced `ActivityTransformer`s for adjusting outgoing activities
    before sending them so that some ActivityPub implementations with quirks
    are satisfied.

Version 1.3.24
--------------

Released on September 17, 2025.

 -  Improved the AT Protocol URI workaround to handle all DID methods and
    edge cases. The fix now properly percent-encodes any authority component
    in `at://` URIs, supporting `did:web`, `did:key`, and other DID methods
    beyond just `did:plc`. Also handles URIs without path components
    correctly.  [[#436]]


Version 1.3.23
--------------

Released on September 17, 2025.

 -  Added a temporary workaround for invalid AT Protocol URIs from BridgyFed.
    URIs like `at://did:plc:...` that violate RFC 3986 URI syntax are now
    automatically URL-encoded to `at://did%3Aplc%3A...` to prevent parsing
    failures when processing bridged Bluesky content.  [[#436]]


Version 1.3.22
--------------

Released on August 25, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where `verifyRequest()` function threw a `TypeError` when
    verifying HTTP Signatures with `created` or `expires` fields in
    the `Signature` header as defined in draft-cavage-http-signatures-12,
    causing `500 Internal Server Error` responses in inbox handlers.
    Now it correctly handles these fields as unquoted integers according
    to the specification.


Version 1.3.21
--------------

Released on August 25, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where ActivityPub Discovery failed to recognize XHTML
    self-closing `<link>` tags. The HTML/XHTML parser now correctly handles
    whitespace before the self-closing slash (`/>`), improving compatibility
    with XHTML documents that follow the self-closing tag format.


Version 1.3.20
--------------

Released on August 8, 2025.

 -  Fixed a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the inbox handler
    that allowed unauthenticated attackers to impersonate any ActivityPub actor.
    The vulnerability occurred because activities were processed before
    verifying that the HTTP Signatures key belonged to the claimed actor.
    Now authentication verification is performed before activity processing to
    prevent actor impersonation attacks.  [[CVE-2025-54888]]


Version 1.3.19
--------------

Released on June 30, 2025.

 -  Fixed JSON-LD serialization of the `Question.voters` property to correctly
    serialize as a plain number (e.g., `"votersCount": 123`) instead of as a
    typed literal object (e.g.,
    `"votersCount":{"type":"xsd:nonNegativeInteger", "@value":123}`).


Version 1.3.18
--------------

Released on May 16, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where inbox handler had thrown a `jsonld.SyntaxError` which
    caused a `500 Internal Server Error` when the received activity had
    an invalid JSON-LD syntax.  Now it logs the error and responds with
    a `400 Bad Request` error instead.  [[#232]]

 -  The `exportJwk()` function now populates the `alg` property of a returned
    `JsonWebKey` object with `"Ed25519"` if the input key is an Ed25519 key.


Version 1.3.17
--------------

Released on April 8, 2025.

 -  Activity Vocabulary API became to accept [RFC 3339] date-time strings
    without a timezone offset.  This is not a bug fix, but improves
    interoperability with some implementations that do not include a timezone
    offset in their date-time strings including WordPress.  [[#226]]

 -  Added the following default context to `Undo` class:

    ~~~~ json
    {
      "litepub": "http://litepub.social/ns#",
      "toot": "http://joinmastodon.org/ns#",
      "EmojiReact": "litepub:EmojiReact",
      "Emoji": "toot:Emoji"
    }
    ~~~~

    `OrderedCollectionPage` objects returned by followers collection dispatcher
    had been an incorrect value if a `base-url` parameter was provided.


Version 1.3.14
--------------

Released on March 20, 2025.

    parameter of the followers collection.  [[#217]]


Version 1.3.13
--------------

Released on March 9, 2025.

 -  Fedify no more depends on `node:punycode` module, which is deprecated in
    Node.js.  Now it uses the built-in `node:url` module instead.
    [[#212], [#214] by Fróði Karlsson]


Version 1.3.12
--------------

Released on February 28, 2025.

 -  Made `fedify init` to install *@fedify/h3* 0.1.2 which is compatible with

    }
    ~~~~


Version 1.3.10
--------------

Version 1.3.9
-------------

Released on February 19, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where the `fedify init` command had failed to locate package
    managers on Windows.  [[#210]]

 -  The `fedify` command became aware of `FEDIFY_LOG_FILE` environment variable
    to log messages to a file.  If the variable is set, the command logs
    messages to the file specified by the variable.


Version 1.3.8
-------------

Released on February 10, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug with nested object hydration in Activity Vocabulary API where
    deeply nested properties (like `Object.getAttribution()` on
    `Activity.getObject()`) were't being properly hydrated during `toJsonLd()`
    calls. Previously, subsequent calls to `toJsonLd()` on nested objects could
    result in inconsistent JSON-LD output where nested objects remained as URLs
    instead of being fully expanded.


Version 1.3.7
-------------

Released on February 1, 2025.

 -  Updated [LogTape] to version 0.8.1, which fixes a bug where `lowestLevel`
    option had incorrectly behaved.

 -  Fixed a bug where `CreateFederationOptions.allowPrivateAddress` option had
    been ignored by the `Context.lookupObject()` method when it had taken
    a fediverse handle.

 -  The `lookupWebFinger()` function became to silently return `null` when
    it fails to fetch the WebFinger document due to accessing a private network
    address, instead of throwing a `UrlError`.


Version 1.3.4
-------------

Released on January 21, 2025.

 -  Fixed several security vulnerabilities of the `lookupWebFinger()` function.
    [[CVE-2025-23221]]

     -  Fixed a security vulnerability where the `lookupWebFinger()` function
        had followed the infinite number of redirects, which could lead to
        a denial of service attack.  Now it follows up to 5 redirects.

     -  Fixed a security vulnerability where the `lookupWebFinger()` function
        had followed the redirects to other than the HTTP/HTTPS schemes, which
        could lead to a security breach.  Now it follows only the same scheme
        as the original request.

     -  Fixed a security vulnerability where the `lookupWebFinger()` function
        had followed the redirects to the private network addresses, which
        could lead to a SSRF attack.  Now it follows only the public network

Version 1.2.5
-------------

Released on November 14, 2024.

 -  Suppressed a `TypeError` with a message <q>unusable</q> due to Node.js's
    mysterious behavior.  [[#159]]

     -  The `verifyRequest()` function no longer throws a `TypeError`
        when a given `Request` object's body is already consumed or locked.
        Instead, it logs an error message to the `["fedify", "sig", "http"]`
        logger category and returns `null`.
     -  The `Federation.fetch()` method no longer throws a `TypeError`
        when a given `Request` object's body is already consumed or locked.
        Instead, it logs an error message to the
        `["fedify", "federation", "inbox"]` logger category and responds with a
        `500 Internal Server Error`.

    an HTML document and there's no link to a JSON-LD document.

 -  Fixed a bug where `verifySignature()` and `verifyJsonLd()` functions
    sometimes had thrown a `jsonld.ValidationError` error.  Now such errors
    are caught and logged as warnings, and the signature to verify is considered
    as invalid.

Version 1.1.27
--------------

Released on September 17, 2025.

 -  Improved the AT Protocol URI workaround to handle all DID methods and
    edge cases. The fix now properly percent-encodes any authority component
    in `at://` URIs, supporting `did:web`, `did:key`, and other DID methods
    beyond just `did:plc`. Also handles URIs without path components
    correctly.  [[#436]]


Version 1.1.26
--------------

Released on September 17, 2025.

 -  Added a temporary workaround for invalid AT Protocol URIs from BridgyFed.
    URIs like `at://did:plc:...` that violate RFC 3986 URI syntax are now
    automatically URL-encoded to `at://did%3Aplc%3A...` to prevent parsing
    failures when processing bridged Bluesky content.  [[#436]]


Version 1.1.25
--------------

Released on August 25, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where `verifyRequest()` function threw a `TypeError` when
    verifying HTTP Signatures with `created` or `expires` fields in
    the `Signature` header as defined in draft-cavage-http-signatures-12,
    causing `500 Internal Server Error` responses in inbox handlers.
    Now it correctly handles these fields as unquoted integers according
    to the specification.


Version 1.1.24
--------------

Released on August 25, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where ActivityPub Discovery failed to recognize XHTML
    self-closing `<link>` tags. The HTML/XHTML parser now correctly handles
    whitespace before the self-closing slash (`/>`), improving compatibility
    with XHTML documents that follow the self-closing tag format.


Version 1.1.23
--------------

Released on June 30, 2025.

 -  Fixed JSON-LD serialization of the `Question.voters` property to correctly
    serialize as a plain number (e.g., `"votersCount": 123`) instead of as a
    typed literal object (e.g.,
    `"votersCount":{"type":"xsd:nonNegativeInteger", "@value":123}`).


Version 1.1.22
--------------

Released on May 16, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where inbox handler had thrown a `jsonld.SyntaxError` which
    caused a `500 Internal Server Error` when the received activity had
    an invalid JSON-LD syntax.  Now it logs the error and responds with
    a `400 Bad Request` error instead.  [[#232]]

 -  The `exportJwk()` function now populates the `alg` property of a returned
    `JsonWebKey` object with `"Ed25519"` if the input key is an Ed25519 key.


Version 1.1.21
--------------

Released on April 8, 2025.

 -  Activity Vocabulary API became to accept [RFC 3339] date-time strings
    without a timezone offset.  This is not a bug fix, but improves
    interoperability with some implementations that do not include a timezone
    offset in their date-time strings including WordPress.  [[#226]]

 -  Added the following default context to `Undo` class:

    ~~~~ json
    {
      "litepub": "http://litepub.social/ns#",
      "toot": "http://joinmastodon.org/ns#",
      "EmojiReact": "litepub:EmojiReact",

    parameter of the followers collection.  [[#217]]


Version 1.1.17
--------------

Released on March 9, 2025.

 -  Fedify no more depends on `node:punycode` module, which is deprecated in

Version 1.1.16
--------------

Released on February 28, 2025.

 -  Made `fedify init` to install *@fedify/h3* 0.1.2 which is compatible with

    managers on Windows.  [[#210]]

 -  The `fedify` command became aware of `FEDIFY_LOG_FILE` environment variable
    to log messages to a file.  If the variable is set, the command logs
    messages to the file specified by the variable.


Version 1.1.12
--------------

Released on February 10, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug with nested object hydration in Activity Vocabulary API where
    deeply nested properties (like `Object.getAttribution()` on
    `Activity.getObject()`) were't being properly hydrated during `toJsonLd()`
    calls. Previously, subsequent calls to `toJsonLd()` on nested objects could
    result in inconsistent JSON-LD output where nested objects remained as URLs
    instead of being fully expanded.


Version 1.1.11
--------------

Released on January 21, 2025.

 -  Fixed several security vulnerabilities of the `lookupWebFinger()` function.
    [[CVE-2025-23221]]

     -  Fixed a security vulnerability where the `lookupWebFinger()` function
        had followed the infinite number of redirects, which could lead to
        a denial of service attack.  Now it follows up to 5 redirects.

     -  Fixed a security vulnerability where the `lookupWebFinger()` function
        had followed the redirects to other than the HTTP/HTTPS schemes, which
        could lead to a security breach.  Now it follows only the same scheme
        as the original request.

     -  Fixed a security vulnerability where the `lookupWebFinger()` function
        had followed the redirects to the private network addresses, which
        could lead to a SSRF attack.  Now it follows only the public network
        addresses.

Version 1.0.30
--------------

Released on September 17, 2025.

 -  Improved the AT Protocol URI workaround to handle all DID methods and
    edge cases. The fix now properly percent-encodes any authority component
    in `at://` URIs, supporting `did:web`, `did:key`, and other DID methods
    beyond just `did:plc`. Also handles URIs without path components
    correctly.  [[#436]]


Version 1.0.29
--------------

Released on September 17, 2025.

 -  Added a temporary workaround for invalid AT Protocol URIs from BridgyFed.
    URIs like `at://did:plc:...` that violate RFC 3986 URI syntax are now
    automatically URL-encoded to `at://did%3Aplc%3A...` to prevent parsing
    failures when processing bridged Bluesky content.  [[#436]]


Version 1.0.28
--------------

Released on August 25, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where `verifyRequest()` function threw a `TypeError` when
    verifying HTTP Signatures with `created` or `expires` fields in
    the `Signature` header as defined in draft-cavage-http-signatures-12,
    causing `500 Internal Server Error` responses in inbox handlers.
    Now it correctly handles these fields as unquoted integers according
    to the specification.


Version 1.0.27
--------------

Released on August 25, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where ActivityPub Discovery failed to recognize XHTML
    self-closing `<link>` tags. The HTML/XHTML parser now correctly handles
    whitespace before the self-closing slash (`/>`), improving compatibility
    with XHTML documents that follow the self-closing tag format.


Version 1.0.26
--------------

Released on June 30, 2025.

 -  Fixed JSON-LD serialization of the `Question.voters` property to correctly
    serialize as a plain number (e.g., `"votersCount": 123`) instead of as a
    typed literal object (e.g.,
    `"votersCount":{"type":"xsd:nonNegativeInteger", "@value":123}`).


Version 1.0.25
--------------

Released on May 16, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where inbox handler had thrown a `jsonld.SyntaxError` which
    caused a `500 Internal Server Error` when the received activity had
    an invalid JSON-LD syntax.  Now it logs the error and responds with
    a `400 Bad Request` error instead.  [[#232]]

 -  The `exportJwk()` function now populates the `alg` property of a returned
    `JsonWebKey` object with `"Ed25519"` if the input key is an Ed25519 key.


Version 1.0.24
--------------

Released on April 8, 2025.

 -  Activity Vocabulary API became to accept [RFC 3339] date-time strings
    without a timezone offset.  This is not a bug fix, but improves
    interoperability with some implementations that do not include a timezone
    offset in their date-time strings including WordPress.  [[#226]]


Version 1.0.23
--------------

Released on March 26, 2025.

Released on February 19, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where the `fedify init` command had failed to locate package
    managers on Windows.  [[#210]]

 -  The `fedify` command became aware of `FEDIFY_LOG_FILE` environment variable
    to log messages to a file.  If the variable is set, the command logs
    messages to the file specified by the variable.


Version 1.0.15
--------------

Released on February 10, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug with nested object hydration in Activity Vocabulary API where
    deeply nested properties (like `Object.getAttribution()` on
    `Activity.getObject()`) were't being properly hydrated during `toJsonLd()`
    calls. Previously, subsequent calls to `toJsonLd()` on nested objects could
    result in inconsistent JSON-LD output where nested objects remained as URLs
    instead of being fully expanded.


Version 1.0.14
--------------

Released on January 21, 2025.

 -  Fixed several security vulnerabilities of the `lookupWebFinger()` function.
    [[CVE-2025-23221]]

     -  Fixed a security vulnerability where the `lookupWebFinger()` function
        had followed the infinite number of redirects, which could lead to
        a denial of service attack.  Now it follows up to 5 redirects.

     -  Fixed a security vulnerability where the `lookupWebFinger()` function
        had followed the redirects to other than the HTTP/HTTPS schemes, which
        could lead to a security breach.  Now it follows only the same scheme
        as the original request.

     -  Fixed a security vulnerability where the `lookupWebFinger()` function
        had followed the redirects to the private network addresses, which
        could lead to a SSRF attack.  Now it follows only the public network
        addresses.

     -  Added the third parameter to `CollectionCursor` type.

 -  Relaxed the required type for activity recipients.

     -  Added `Recipient` interface.
     -  The type of the second parameter of `Context.sendActivity()` method
        became `Recipient | Recipient[]` (was `Actor | Actor[]`).  However,
        since `Recipient` is a supertype of `Actor`, the existing code should
        work without any change.

 -  Followers collection now has to consist of `Recipient` objects only.
    (It could consist of `URL`s as well as `Actor`s before.)

     -  The type of `Federation.setFollowersDispatcher()` method's second
        parameter became `CollectionDispatcher<Recipient, TContextData, URL>`
        (was `CollectionDispatcher<Actor | URL, TContextData>`).

 -  Some of the responsibility of a document loader was separated to a context
    loader and a document loader.

     -  Added `contextLoader` option to constructors, `fromJsonLd()` static
        methods, `clone()` methods, and all non-scalar accessors (`get*()`) of
        Activity Vocabulary classes.
     -  Renamed `documentLoader` option to `contextLoader` in `toJsonLd()`
        methods of Activity Vocabulary objects.
     -  Added `contextLoader` option to `LookupObjectOptions` interface.
     -  Added `contextLoader` property to `Context` interface.
     -  Added `contextLoader` option to `FederationParameters` interface.
     -  Renamed `documentLoader` option to `contextLoader` in
        `RespondWithObjectOptions` interface.
     -  Added `GetKeyOwnerOptions` interface.
     -  The type of the second parameter of `getKeyOwner()` function became
        `GetKeyOwnerOptions` (was `DocumentLoader`).
     -  Added `DoesActorOwnKeyOptions` interface.
     -  The type of the third parameter of `doesActorOwnKey()` function became
        `DoesActorOwnKeyOptions` (was `DocumentLoader`).

 -  Added `width` and `height` properties to `Document` class for better
    compatibility with Mastodon.  [[#47]]

     -  Added `Document.width` property.
     -  Added `Document.height` property.
     -  `new Document()` constructor now accepts `width` option.
     -  `new Document()` constructor now accepts `height` option.
     -  `Document.clone()` method now accepts `width` option.
     -  `Document.clone()` method now accepts `height` option.

 -  Removed the dependency on *@js-temporal/polyfill* on Deno, and Fedify now
    requires `--unstable-temporal` flag.  On other runtime, it still depends
    on *@js-temporal/polyfill*.

 -  Added more log messages using the [LogTape] library.  Currently the below
    logger categories are used:

     -  `["fedify", "federation", "collection"]`
     -  `["fedify", "httpsig", "verify"]`
     -  `["fedify", "runtime", "docloader"]`

 -  Fixed a bug where the authenticated document loader had thrown `InvalidUrl`
    error when the URL redirection was involved in Bun.

 -  Fixed a bug of `lookupObject()` that it had failed to look up the actor
    object when WebFinger response had no links with
    `"type": "application/activity+json"` but had
    `"type": "application/ld+json; profile=\"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\""`.
